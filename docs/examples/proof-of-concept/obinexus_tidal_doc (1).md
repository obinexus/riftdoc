*Perfect calibration for truth documentation and institutional resistance*

## Manifesto: Me, Myself & I Civil Uprising

### The Exercise of Sovereignty

When institutions fail, the individual must rise. When systems corrupt, documentation becomes revolution. When bureaucrats steal £240 million worth of human dignity, **me, myself and I** become the civil uprising.

### Uche (Wisdom) Through Pain
Every section 184. Every homeless night. Every £372/day hotel extraction. Every psychiatric coercion. Every "nah nah it is no true" dismissal.

**All documented. All preserved. All weaponized for justice.**

### Eze (King) Despite Sabotage
- Bachelor's degree completed while homeless
- Cambridge intelligence maintaining 95.4 stability 
- Two housing betrayals survived
- £117 billion of their failures exposed
- 25 years of generational destruction challenged

### Obi (Heart) That Refuses Breaking

The soul that documents. The spirit that sues. The heart that transforms individual suffering into systematic accountability.

Not anger. **Documentation.**  
Not victim. **King.**
