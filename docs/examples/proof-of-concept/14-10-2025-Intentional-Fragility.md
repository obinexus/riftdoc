What theoretical rationale supports intentional fragility as a structural principle?

How does designed fragility function as a safeguard against coercive stability?

In what ways might fragility enforce ethical accountability within a system of governance?

How can fragility coexist with resilience without diluting either concept?

What mechanisms ensure that fragility invites reflection rather than exploitation?

How is responsibility distributed when a fragile system fails as intended?

To what extent does deliberate fragility challenge traditional engineering ethics?

How does user trust evolve in systems that openly acknowledge their vulnerability?

What distinguishes sacred fragility (protective) from negligent fragility (destructive)?

Can a fragile-by-design framework scale without betraying its own philosophical core?

Hello everyone, welcome back. Uh today I
0:04
want to speak about something called the
0:06
proper pro protocol. It's a uh
0:09
innovation in uh health and social care.
0:10
I'm trying to push forward. Uh uh the
0:14
proper protocol refers to um uh it's a
0:18
the proper method which is the perfect
0:21
technique. Uh it allows uh psychiatrist
0:24
to uh uh do something uh to help uh to
0:28
help release
0:30
uh gets uh uh severely distic uh
0:34
disabled uh individuals uh at risk very
0:37
verbal individuals they can't speak uh
0:40
they have non-verbal autism we don't
0:41
understand why they can't speak uh or
0:44
talk uh how their brain is putting
0:46
information
0:48
uh to talk or speak you know if it does
0:51
work if there's still some help you can
0:52
give them uh the goal is to sort it out
0:55
six years old or 5 years old you know
0:57
but children uh in the UK and just or
0:59
five uh respectively uh based on their
1:02
capacity.
1:04
Uh but you know the younger the better
1:06
uh if it can be four or three uh we're
1:08
trying to figure out how autism uh
1:11
develops or severe autism develops to
1:14
change the life of many autistic
1:15
individuals. Uh the pop-up protocol is
1:18
just a technique uh that works like
1:20
this. So uh you have a puppet uh you say
1:23
you have a puppet uh the puppet is the
1:25
anchor to that individual
1:28
uh you know it's about getting that
1:30
individual
1:32
to understand uh subjectively who they
1:35
are uh depending you know there's no
1:37
interjection you know you have to get to
1:40
understand do you want this kind of
1:41
color do you want this kind of thing you
1:43
know but that puppet has to look like
1:45
them has to be don't look like them
1:47
internalize how they are in that state
1:50
you So as they develop then they can
1:51
change the covers closing you know um
1:54
you know and if they introduce that's
1:56
the trick with the puppets you know the
1:57
goal is to give every autistic
1:58
individual uh severely a puppet you know
2:00
a puppet to hold you know and speaking
2:03
know what is the shyness we try to
2:04
understand uh without giving them
2:07
medication it's not about medication
2:08
treatment it's about what a psychologist
2:11
psychologist can look at and say yes
2:13
he's getting better or yes there's
2:16
something that's improving you know
2:18
toify Autism, you know, what is autism
2:21
for sever uh uh to be autistic or
2:24
severely autistic? You know, once you
2:26
get some people to understand, you know,
2:27
people start speaking can explain what
2:29
is happening to them in their own minds.
2:31
You know, that is the goal of this
2:32
research project. The goal here is to
2:34
get people to uh uh understand uh or
2:38
people who simply can't talk to to be in
2:40
schools uh to social um you can trick
2:43
them through puppetry you know whether
2:45
they like to talk or not talk or use
2:47
sound you know customize uh personal
2:50
development puppet something they can
2:51
anchor which is an anchor to their being
2:54
you know it's a technique is applies um
2:56
to everyone but it's a method too what
2:58
is a method it's model agnostic it
3:00
applies to everyone
3:02
which is for definition technique. Uh so
3:04
that's a proper it allows for people to
3:07
uh
3:08
uh talk and talk and talk and talk and
3:10
talk uh without being uh
3:15
uh you know whether they want to do
3:16
something to change their password. you
3:18
know that puppet is meant to be their
3:19
anchor needs to be clean, dressed uh and
3:22
reflect their true nature uh using
3:25
personal development framework and uh
3:28
and which is just a method of uh
3:32
of the of doing something uh properly.
3:36
Uh now it goes we also go to the persona
3:37
development framework you know this
3:39
really gets autism people it's just a
3:40
general thing uh persona is by uh Kun is
3:46
a is a concept uh that says persona is
3:49
static you know it's what people want to
3:51
show to the world but that's a false
3:52
negative uh didn't do any research to
3:56
claim that uh I'm claiming that persona
3:59
is never static uh it's the it's a it's
4:01
always evolving a persona I define a
4:04
persona is Persona is what people want
4:06
to show to the world. Uh what they want
4:08
to be seen like I have a tattoo. Uh this
4:11
is my culture. This is my origin. The
4:13
term persona refers to personal identity
4:15
like you know my what I want to
4:17
personify to you. You know it's same in
4:19
a workplace I want to be professional
4:21
working you know to that people. Uh and
4:24
this is a true thing you know say for
4:26
example you have a doctor a doctor want
4:28
to become a doctor.
4:30
Uh the doctor is speaking in in tongues.
4:33
You know you have a say you have a
4:34
patient patient you know you're going to
4:36
have you know you're going to have
4:37
cardiac arrest if you don't stop eating
4:39
uh pizza and all this junk food you know
4:42
that's the medical term he's using in
4:44
your face card means heart attack you
4:47
know in a month's in one one and a half
4:49
months time if you don't stop eating all
4:51
this junk food now that doctor has fully
4:53
translated that information because the
4:55
person is developing or develop but you
4:57
know he's not really anchored the
4:58
meaning into that individual that he's
5:00
talking like and that overweight
5:02
individual who's trying to because his
5:05
language is very poor uh his poor
5:06
communication he's technically advanced
5:08
but his commission is poor which is the
5:10
bridge he has uh to express that thing
5:13
he's a formal terminology you know when
5:15
your teacher start speaking jag some PG
5:17
classes the teach some terminology and
5:20
still continue talking about it uh it
5:22
hinders the ability for student to learn
5:25
uh or grasp that concept uh at a higher
5:29
level of the hilipino it doesn't uh give
5:31
him credibility just makes him look
5:33
stupid either as well you know like you
5:34
know I'm speaking to you is but you know
5:36
he's not doing on purpose he may be
5:38
doing on purpose he's not doing on
5:39
purpose because his persona that's the
5:40
he want to show to people but you know
5:43
he forgets uh he forgets that he may
5:45
forget that you know persona is what but
5:47
the thing about person is very dynamic
5:50
it's conscious about I can say you know
5:52
say you have a
5:54
one second
6:00
uh one second once again One second. Um,
6:03
so if you see this image on the my
6:05
screen here, it's it's about a woman
6:07
with a good persona. She's like a f
6:10
strong leader outlet, you know, someone
6:12
that uh person development is not
6:15
people. It's the people who you want to
6:16
admire. You look at them and see I want
6:18
to be like that. Uh because so developed
6:21
they are like actively pulling on you.
6:24
Your conscious to be that businessman
6:26
that business woman or this kind of
6:27
sports you know this is a sports
6:28
example. This is a person. It's a
6:30
snapshot of a person's uh uhization
6:33
process like a what you want to show to
6:35
the world like you know this is me.
6:37
Yeah. So this this an image but it
6:38
really uh grounds that concept to you
6:41
because you know I want you to anchor
6:43
this image if you don't understand
6:44
anything I say. Uh personal development
6:46
is just like uh this this woman she has
6:48
a tattoo here uh showing that she she's
6:52
using this sport. Uh she's ready for the
6:54
game. and she's she's not doing a peace
6:57
sign peace sign you know and she got
6:59
ripped abs she got she got like ripped
7:01
abs you know this the kind of thing I
7:04
want you to understand you know she's a
7:05
she's a volleyball and she's one of the
7:07
best uh volleyballist in uh in Japan or
7:11
China or Korea or China some place in
7:13
the world but you know she goes to
7:16
places she lives by the land by the sea
7:18
you know this was kind of a n and this
7:19
is her coat you know this is her coat
7:21
this her she will win she's her she's so
7:24
confident she knows how to play the game
7:27
uh the volleyball game. uh this what the
7:29
personality development states the
7:30
person is developing uh it's influenced
7:33
by it may be influenced by environment
7:35
uh factors you know uh the curated uh
7:38
what you call the created u the created
7:40
duality of uh uh
7:45
what is it um something
7:50
uh which is like you know this is just a
7:52
picture of uh yes but you know who
7:54
understands my uh development system uh
7:57
so she's a lady uh that's not real, but
7:59
you understands uh you understand what
8:01
she is. She's a woman. Her persona is
8:04
developed. She's anchored that thing
8:05
into she's a volleyballist and she's
8:07
proud. She's smiling. Uh that's what I'm
8:10
trying to say to you. So, we got uh the
8:12
puppet pop protocol. Now, this is the
8:16
personal development. You know, when you
8:17
see your son playing with the uh thing,
8:19
it's about uh understanding having true
8:23
identity and show who you are. I'm proud
8:26
of it, you know. Uh People say they are
8:28
the prime. This is what they mean. You
8:29
know this example of what they mean.
8:30
This you see here. This what they mean.
8:32
I'm a prime. You know I can't be messed
8:34
up. I'm in a flow state. You know
8:36
whether you know it or not. I'm in a
8:38
flow state. Uh you know this uh this uh
8:41
thing mean she works as a maybe she can
8:43
can say she works at a fish and fish
8:45
shop like you know selling chai fish
8:47
kaiish uh which is delicious fish in
8:49
Japan I believe. I don't know. But this
8:52
her personal develop is something that
8:54
she internalizes herself as a dity
8:57
anchor to her hometown when she she
8:59
plays vol when she goes she plays. Uh
9:02
now uh that's what person development
9:04
framework is all about. It's about uh
9:07
being uh being seen uh but not being
9:10
manipulated. Uh it's about your true
9:13
self. Who am I? What do I show to the
9:15
world? Uh which I call authentic
9:17
persona. Uh now uh the thing about
9:20
personal development you got a person
9:21
development you now got um uh people who
9:24
are like persona uh personal disorder uh
9:27
positive versus opposite of personal
9:29
development. It refers to one second.
9:33
Okay. Um so this is civil collapse uh
9:36
and you know civil collapse is a term I
9:38
call it's a political term because a lot
9:40
of things happened to my house and I'm
9:42
24 I mean social care 184 social care.
9:45
uh civil collapse refers to the collapse
9:47
that uh no one's getting houses and
9:50
social care health or social care system
9:52
uh it's a term I coined uh to blame my
9:55
situation uh whether it's food water
9:57
shelter and security because right now
9:59
I'm ination
10:00
uh which is health and security reform
10:02
or the or reform and access research
10:04
development to uh uh for all departments
10:08
to uh sustainability
10:11
uh which are services reform reform uh
10:15
obnoxuting
10:19
research. Open access uh uh access
10:22
access to open access uh access which
10:26
access R&D research development
10:28
department is the open uh open
10:32
access computing uh the know based on
10:35
the two principles you know uh but you
10:38
know this is civil collapse civil
10:40
collapse is a term and it means a
10:42
civilian collapse um the because you
10:45
know it's not like a war collapse
10:46
there's a lot of fighting in a system
10:49
because of the struggle in the system of
10:51
housing or on barebones or foundational
10:54
systems where the civil versus civilian
10:56
matters you know whether people are
10:58
rich. So uh because of what I
10:59
experienced people understanding that um
11:02
people are people simply think
11:03
themselves as too much and they have
11:05
houses people who are political office
11:06
to just talk and nonsense the what I
11:09
call bureaucrats or council the
11:11
bureaucratic just talk um using 700
11:13
million
11:15
million pounds uh by 2024 2023 and not
11:18
be able to house me I was homeless under
11:21
system from November 28th January uh
11:25
which I called the civil collapse uh I
11:27
didn't get a property I still
11:28
resignation here. Uh the civil collapse
11:31
manifesto is really about uh
11:34
understanding what's happening around
11:36
you. Uh this is a political term uh for
11:39
explaining uh bureaucratic decisions uh
11:42
and not uh doing jobs correctly. Hence
11:45
civilian collapse. It involves civilian.
11:49
Uh so this young person the gen Z is
11:51
like
11:53
the gen Z refers to uh my generation but
11:56
this is on behalf of see this person
11:58
this person disorder but you know I
12:00
learned about I have develop because I
12:02
have a something called clinical depress
12:05
have depression because I am angry
12:07
depressed but I'm depressed because uh
12:09
my actions are not I'm not can't do I'm
12:11
not tell that kind of depression I have
12:13
it's just being a uh work so there's no
12:16
direction forward it's like a no way
12:19
forward for me and this what I'm saying
12:20
it is civilian collapse uh hence the
12:23
reform act division for to protect my
12:25
business I lost uh some money for three
12:27
months three months to generate to uh
12:30
get housing uh but but use that money to
12:33
get out of health and social care uh but
12:36
they want to give me a house in which is
12:38
the promise to fight for 270 million
12:40
pounds them uh so this is my manifesto
12:42
this is what I wrote this is
12:45
the picture of someone who is on the
12:48
has been watch observed through cameras
12:51
see the houses no it's a civilian
12:54
collapse you know see how the no one's
12:56
doing house no one's building houses
12:57
being in flats you know everyone is lost
13:00
and this is what I mean uh this this
13:02
internalize this image you know this is
13:04
uh this an uh about civil collapse
13:10
uh yep uh so we got one more thing to
13:13
show you so you know this collapse you
13:16
know this mation of personal When people
13:18
have this person develop disorder,
13:19
they're referring to the uh people who
13:21
are maniacs or crazy or angry or
13:23
depressed. because the person has
13:25
flipped uh they can't really uh uh focus
13:29
on the cruel because they have
13:30
foundational needs you know because you
13:32
know uh when they people can't do stuff
13:34
say foundational needs and uh do truck
13:37
system uh you have a Alexa pause you
13:40
have a expression truck what you want to
13:42
do and you got the foundation track
13:44
where you going to sustain to be the
13:47
food water shelter which is a you know
13:49
foundation means sustainability of the
13:51
expiration track you know you can't
13:53
personally develop without the
13:56
foundation
13:57
get without the bay bones you know and
13:59
that's why I'm
14:01
depressed
14:03
uh yes uh and we got one more we got um
14:07
one more I solic you know say you have a
14:09
child uh the peggy uh I'm going to give
14:12
you example say you the problem this one
14:14
problem you know um children are meant
14:16
to play outside world games no what I'm
14:19
saying is we got the game system for
14:22
children got peg three which is
14:24
university so anyone can play U games
14:26
which is three H3 plus uh H7 plus is uh
14:32
PG priority to guidance uh so the
14:34
problem I solved is uh age ration you
14:37
know uh you know when you when you have
14:39
a child sitting next to you a child
14:40
wants to play a game like 16 or 15 14 I
14:43
mean uh seven they have to be three plus
14:46
to play that game like FIFA uh which is
14:49
three or like Skylanders which is a game
14:52
uh I mean it is like uh three plus is
14:54
the age for that game and that's what
14:56
I'm saying to you. So you have a three
14:58
plus so they have to be three or six or
15:00
five or not seven to play. So but you
15:02
have to get on the you get a person to
15:04
guide them and watch them to understand
15:05
how they process information you know
15:07
because you can process it anyhow you
15:09
know but when your person is there
15:11
there's kind of a a guidance you know uh
15:14
whether it's one hour or two hours of a
15:16
PS5 or PS4 or Xbox or or Nintendo Switch
15:20
or any console for that matter you're
15:22
playing this on the printer is like a
15:24
guidance to play that game you know this
15:27
uh this is part of wish development I'm
15:28
trying to autism uh people with autism
15:30
people who are in
15:32
uh for my uh for my systems uh which
15:35
should which should work on fear,
15:36
uncertainty and down principles which is
15:38
uh uh to mitigate them. So no fear, no
15:41
you know because you know if you have a
15:42
computer system but a bad UI U6 and just
15:44
a normal UIUX uh a normal people can use
15:48
okay a normal person without autism use
15:50
okay but a disabled person like me
15:51
sometimes will struggle with that system
15:53
to uh well and you have troubles
15:56
navigating that system uh that would be
15:58
bad for the majority of the people you
16:01
know who are autistic who have
16:02
disability has a broken hand uh and the
16:05
typing and just type on a computer that
16:08
broken hand will be uh bad for them to
16:11
do something with because you know it's
16:13
like it's going to be painful tapping on
16:14
keyboard or something like that. Hence
16:16
the f mitigation is you know if a if a
16:19
if a if a normal person can use a system
16:21
okay a disabled person which is a four
16:24
concept we have a problem struggle with
16:26
will struggle using a system
16:30
yes will struggle using a system and
16:32
that's what the four layer is meant to
16:34
mitigate you know uh if a if a if a
16:37
normal person perfectly I mean not okay
16:40
or perfectly almost near near perfectly
16:43
person will find it okay or near okay
16:46
you get that's the idea I want to give
16:47
you of the fun so that's what it's all
16:49
about so talking about civil collapse uh
16:52
reform UK reforming something uh age
16:55
ring guidance like you know 37 plus uh
16:58
16 18 24 15 you know when you guide the
17:02
countries to mature in a correct
17:03
coherent way so you don't they don't
17:06
misunderstand or misinterpret something
17:08
that you watch whether it's
17:09
adult or not. And that's the layer of uh
17:13
trying to express. Uh so that's the
17:16
thing. Uh you can go back, save this
17:18
video if you really care about autism,
17:19
if you care autism, but understand what
17:21
autism is. Autism is just a neurodyiver
17:24
development disorder uh in the brain. Uh
17:27
but normally a disorder can empower
17:28
people which is normally it's really
17:30
debated but normally uh it's a hot topic
17:32
uh right now. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.
17:34
Take care. Okay. Have a lovely one.

The Puppet Method Protocol implements a distributed identity anchoring system for non-verbal neurodivergent individuals, transforming the paradigm from deficit-based interventions to sovereignty-based authentic expression. This open-source framework bridges the critical gap between internal experience and external communication through tangible, accessible identity infrastructure.

## **Core Architecture**

### **System Overview**


python
class PuppetMethodProtocol:
    """
    Distributed identity expression system for non-verbal communication
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.identity_anchor = SovereignIdentityModule()
        self.boundary_enforcer = OwnershipProtocolSystem()
        self.expression_bridge = MultiModalTranslator()
        self.validation_network = ConsensusValidator(validators=21)


### **Fundamental Principles**

1. **Identity Sovereignty**: Each puppet represents inviolable personal identity
2. **Boundary Integrity**: Strict ownership protocols prevent identity violation
3. **Autonomous Design**: Individual-driven creation without external interference
4. **Bridge Architecture**: Translation layer between internal states and external expression

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Phase-Based Development Protocol**


python
class DevelopmentPhaseManager:
    PHASES = {
        'initialization': AgeBasedTrigger(minimum_age=6),
        'anchoring': IdentityFormationProtocol(),
        'bridge_construction': CommunicationDevelopment(),
        'validation': DualChannelAssessment()
    }
    
    def execute_protocol(self, participant):
        # Autonomous identity creation
        puppet = self.initialize_sovereign_anchor(participant)
        
        # Continuous observation without interference
        while participant.engages_with(puppet):
            self.record_expression_patterns()
            self.maintain_boundary_integrity()
            
        # Bridge to verbal emergence (if applicable)
        return self.measure_authentic_development()


### **Validation Network Architecture**


python
class ValidationNetwork:
    """
    Distributed consensus mechanism preventing identity hijacking
    """
    def __init__(self, validator_count=21, consensus_threshold=0.67):
        self.validators = self.select_independent_validators(validator_count)
        self.threshold = consensus_threshold
        
    def validate_identity_registration(self, puppet_identity):
        validation_results = parallel_map(
            lambda v: v.assess_authenticity(puppet_identity),
            self.validators
        )
        
        if consensus_ratio(validation_results) >= self.threshold:
            return self.register_sovereign_identity(puppet_identity)
        raise ValidationException("Insufficient consensus")


## **Measurement Framework**

### **Dual-Channel Assessment Protocol**

**Subjective Reality Indicators**:
- Puppet design complexity evolution
- Emotional engagement patterns
- Self-initiated interaction frequency
- Personality consistency projection

**Objective Reality Measurements**:
- Communication attempt quantification
- Social interaction duration
- Behavioral regulation improvements
- Verbal emergence milestones

### **Success Metric Formula**


Success = (Authentic Identity Development → Communication) / (Time × Minimal Support)


## **Security & Integrity Guarantees**

1. **Temporal Immutability**: All expressions timestamped and cryptographically sealed
2. **Boundary Enforcement**: Automatic violation detection with intervention protocols
3. **Evolution Tracking**: Continuous identity development monitoring
4. **Consensus Validation**: 67% agreement required from 21 independent validators

## **Universal Access Design**


python
class UniversalAccessProtocol:
    REQUIREMENTS = {
        'materials': 'Any puppet from local shop',
        'cost': 'Under $20',
        'training': 'Simple instruction sheet',
        'location': 'Home, school, anywhere',
        'professional_involvement': 'Optional'
    }

“So, let's start again. So, data protection supports intentional fragility. Okay, my name is Andy. I am autistic, PhD, and I research with the Mount Lansing Project. Therefore, I am proposing as a foundation, as a neurodivergent individual, supporting intentional fragility. The structural principle is wanted in my divergent study. Therefore, the foundation, functional infrastructure, is based on my statement, which is authentic.”

You said:
“We do cover all of that and how this works in my head.”
00:04
You said:
“Yes, so basically, it's about, for me, I was in an institution, I think I was 15 to 16, 16 to 17, 15 to 17, I came out in 2016, but for almost two years I stayed there. I didn't know because I said I saw a UFO, and they violated the protocol to put me there, and now I'm finally alone, so just to claim the money, I didn't, because if I don't claim it by the end of 25 years old, it's impossible to claim it, which is probably 30 million pounds per se, but it's kind of like a resolution for my, you know, honestly, I can't stay at home forever if I don't get out of social care, because it's over 25 under the UK Act of 2014. So basically, it's that kind of look ahead for me that really matters, not even like, not even like the, because I'm just watching myself mostly, but you know, if I have a girlfriend, I can watch my girlfriend, but you know, I am just looking at my objectives. So Monique, can you answer the question for me? Based on your observations, what is the theoretical, rational, supportational fragility as a structural principle?”
01:01
You said:
“Give me an analogy regarding this intentional fragility and what is worth implementation in a real-world application stuff. I want to see where you go with this. Based on entropy, give me some track record with entropy.”

You said:
“I only believe it's more about inference, because now you have something like a variant-query matrix, then you have the inference, you have the check, too. It may seem more like that to me, at the more competition level, based on our gating principles, X, Y, Z testing. But you know, if the system can really cohere what it does, and not cohere inferiorly, that's just more subset of problems, if you are depending on where you're working. So I'm thinking of this more of a dimensional game theory, where if someone, if an attacker works on an invariant pose a problem, they are working to attack someone they consider an attacker, who's using an invariant set of problems to tackle the system, constrain to them that there are two isomorphic layers, but they solve the same problem, but for different instances, phenomenological matching. Because you know, if a red team and a blue team are hacking each other, and there's normally a dimensional strategy, there is a dimensional strategy performed, they are working on like a hack-the-box challenge, or some more attack-the-box, you know, capture-the-flag. They are pen-testing, but they don't really understand the alignment, but they do understand that they have to solve a problem, but they solve the same problem to begin with, and that's when one gets attacked or something like that, and they say, oh, I now have a new insight based on this ABC. But it's not because they are fragile, or they really want to get hacked one day, it's because they were so sensitive to getting hacked, now they are able to solve new problems.”

“Yes, it reminds me more of my ZY gate because, you know, my goal is really to reduce the problem to the Y state for the X state, you know, but I can gate any way I like because I don't want to gate to the pipeline because, you know, if I keep testing stuff and everything is coherent, then I should handle more integration at the lower level of the X gating, which is like an S-CAN-BAN gating to do gate, what would you do next? What I'm doing to do is agile based on a team model, it doesn't really break per se, it's like, you know, I'm able to encode more logic information into a design of a system, not the actual implementation with that overhead, because it reminds me more, and UX really reminds me of OBX, GitHub deconstruct OBIX, which is like a hard UI UX library, you know, I can integrate more into the, it looks like React, it feels like React, but it's not React, because, you know, the goal, if I can, you know, integrate all that code into all that, all that logic into the design itself of the technology, it doesn't really, the people, all you need to do, with no business logic, with no business logic, then that is a pluralist limit, because, you know, the business logic just really represents, like, the thing that needs to run, and that can fragment the whole system, if it's not running coherently, too. So, if I have a silicon, with a brain membrane, and that will defragment the system, you don't really need to defragment the system, you just need to have that more architectural principle, and the infrastructure, which my life working on, my two-year work, my master's and PhD, you can write all that code, and stick it onto a silicon drive, you know, and then get people to use that silicon, you know, that will not degrade for a long time, whether it's hybrid or not, you know, it's meant to separate the business logic, things that are running for the operating system, for the user, for the business, what is the AI system or something, from the actual infrastructure. So, yeah.”

You said:
“Yes, it reminds me more of like what is structure, what is structure, you know, I can say to you the one defined 0 or 1 as a boolean is structured, yes. What can be 0 for? So 1 or 0, 0 means on, 0 means off by default, 1 means on, simple computer terminology. Well, I can also design this, it's a binary computer, you can also model a ternary system with three inputs. I won't get into the three inputs per se. Now, the IOTA state is better this way, but you know, this is a ternary system, they can say it's a 0, 1, or 2 per se, but it's a ternary. Basically, let's just use a standard 0, 1, or 2. Basically, you've got a ternary 0, 1, or 2, 0 and 1, which are one, which is like, you know, it computes, but you know, it has three, uses three numbers to encode a state, looks like a number, or information, anything, a program, logic. But you've got 0, which is a binary ternary, that's the only difference. But I can say to you, I would prefer the ternary system over the the, the, the, the, the, the classical thing, because you can have more information to flow, and can work better. But they have computers, because they're computing over triplets, which is a computer non-standard. But, you know, I'm basically saying that non-standard of a triplet model is because, you know, people, because, you know, it's hard for computers to work with triplets, or like odd numbers, naturally, because of the nature of odd numbers. But what if my brain works in, what if I just learn to count in threes, instead of like 1, 2, 3, 1 or 2, instead of ones, because, you know, like they, but that would be like more intuitive for me, that would be my iota state. You get what I mean?”

“If the active system doesn't have the full lensing to see that change, it doesn't matter the active system. If you can define a compression algorithm that is lossy, you're going to lose insights in that sense. Because the compression algorithm doesn't see the full picture, it's not 100% coherent because it doesn't know the state to act, it's going to have the same problem. So basically, the lossless algorithms are the go-to, like Huffman encoding, which is how you can use AVL to balance the states to find the resolution, because there's no point of looking at something that can't really debug, because you can try to look at it, you can find it visually over time, but if you're not looking at that state already, it's going to be a silent failure, and the problem is going to compile, the compiler is going to build everything, but the problem with the compiler is it won't tell you, it won't build an error until you encourage it in production.”
01:33
You said:
“Have I answered the first question correctly or incorrectly? I'm going to move to the second one now. I'm thinking out loud. What theoretical, rational, support, intentional, structural principle... Basically, the more I see this, the more I get... Let's say, like a malware. It doesn't matter whether it's a biological virus or anything, whether it's a mind virus, but it's like something that takes over a host entity, like a zombie. At least it's a zombie apocalypse, but it's intentionally caused by a human or something. You're going to have some sort of genetic trait that makes everyone human. But that, because it's rare and everything, it's because the system is meant to actually have that kind of diversity. Because if that system is like everyone looks the same, everyone feels the same, then that system is what? It's naturally coherent. Because it's not like a simple virus. Maybe everyone looks the same or feels the same, everything looks the same. Let's say everywhere is blue, everywhere is red or something like that, then that system doesn't have a way to handle what it's not going to expect. Once someone sees blue, everything is red for one day, and then once someone sees blue, something like that, it's not only going to be comprehensible, and the whole system will be coherent.”

You said:
“Yeah, yeah, it's like, you know, once we're together, like, the worst kind of virus on the body, you know, like, you know, they have a virus and they, and they do them, they don't really do themselves, because they are, everyone's brought a virus and disease every day, hence vaccines. Well, vaccines can only guide the evolution, but they don't really do nothing, because they're normally, because we get a new one every year. I see, like, we're getting a kind of medicine too, but, you know, you can get a medicine that, that's, that's, that, you know, that helps you grow, like, but it doesn't really directly, it actually helps you directly do something without taking it frequently. You get it, but, you know, you don't really need to rely on it, you know, per se, because you rely on your natural system to form the immunity to do what we need to do.”

“If I said to the councilor right now, I want to live in an outskirts of somewhere, I want to become a farmer. For me, only when I say that I want to become a farmer to live happily, she can get her house in a farm area, which is like a rural area, and they say, no, no, no, you don't need a house to me. It's not a kind of farm. If I've been thinking for so long as an ambition, because I'm not fragile per se, it becomes an ambition of mine that's being decohered. That aligns with my nature and nature view, or my persona, or something. In the rural vicinity, but you know, it's not. And they represent me, they represent pushing back on my views, on my worldview, and somehow I want to live. It really doesn't align with the system, because I don't really give the system permission to do something. I just do it anyway. What does the system give us? And people want to get farms, and I think people want to get farms, but they don't even ask that question. So I don't really think it's a break-in per se. I think it's the system trying to explore new avenues.”
