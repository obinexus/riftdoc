### 1. Introduction

```
The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria
(Onwuatuegwu, 2023), primarily inhabiting the southeastern part
of the country. They have a rich cultural heritage that spans
centuries and encompasses various aspects of life, including
language, art, music, religion, and socio-political systems. The
Igbo are known for their entrepreneurial spirit, resilience, and
strong community ties.
Socio-political systems play a crucial role in shaping the identity,
values, and behaviour of a society. They provide a framework for
governance, decision-making, and social organization within a
community. Understanding the socio-political systems of a culture
helps to shed light on its power dynamics, social structure, and the
values that underpin its functioning (Nnoli, 1981). In the case of
the Igbo people, their socio-political systems are integral to their
```
```
cultural identity and have played a significant role in shaping their
history and worldview.
Oha na Eze is a fundamental principle in Igbo socio-political
systems, representing the relationship between the community
(Oha) and the traditional ruler or king (Eze). It encompasses the
concept of communal governance, consensus-building, and
collective decision-making. Oha na Eze highlights the
interdependence and mutual accountability between the ruler and
the people, emphasizing the importance of a harmonious
relationship for the well-being and progress of the community
(Uzodinma & Onwumere, 2017). This concept embodies the
democratic nature of Igbo governance systems, where power is
shared and decisions are made through inclusive processes
involving the entire community.

This concept reflects the egalitarian nature of the Igbo society,
where power is not concentrated solely in the hands of a monarch
or ruler but is rather shared among the people as a whole. Oha na
Eze recognizes that the well-being of the community depends on
the harmonious interaction between its members and the ruler,
emphasizing the importance of unity, cooperation, and consensus-
building (Afigbo, 1981).

In Igbo tradition, the Eze (king) serves as the custodian of the
people's welfare and the embodiment of their collective aspirations.
However, the Eze's authority is not absolute; it is balanced by the
Oha (the people), who have the right to participate in decision-
making processes and hold the ruler accountable. This system
fosters a sense of inclusiveness, ensuring that the interests and
concerns of all members of the community are heard and
considered (Mezie, 1999).

Oha na Eze extends beyond political governance and permeates
various aspects of Igbo society. It influences the organization of
extended families, villages, and town unions, promoting a sense of
communal identity and cohesion. The concept also extends to
conflict resolution, as disputes are often settled through
deliberative processes involving representatives of the Oha and the
Eze (Uchendu, 1965).

Furthermore, Oha na Eze encapsulates the principles of justice,
fairness, and equity. It upholds the notion that decisions should be
made for the greater good of the community, taking into account
the diverse perspectives and needs of its members. Through this
concept, the Igbo people strive to maintain social harmony and
ensure the well-being and progress of their society (Njoku, 1997).

In this exploration of Oha na Eze, we shall delve into the historical
significance and contemporary relevance of this foundational
concept in the Igbo socio-political system. We shall equally
examine its role in governance, community development, and
conflict resolution, highlighting the unique characteristics and
values that underpin the Igbo society. Understanding Oha na Eze is
crucial to comprehending the Igbo people's social and political
dynamics, their values of consensus, equity, and participatory
decision-making. It provides insights into how leadership and
governance are perceived within Igbo culture and sheds light on
their communal approach to problem-solving and community
development.

### 2. Igbo Socio-Political Evolution

The Igbo people are an ethnic group predominantly residing in
southeastern Nigeria. The origins of the Igbo society are believed
to be ancient and complex, with various theories and
archaeological evidence suggesting different migration patterns
and cultural influences.

According to oral tradition, the Igbo people trace their ancestry to a
common ancestor named Eri. It is believed that Eri migrated from
the eastern region of present-day Nigeria, possibly from the Nri-
Awka area, and settled in the Igbo heartland. Over time, the Igbo
society evolved through the integration of diverse groups and
interactions with neighbouring cultures (Onwuatuegwu, I. N.,
2020).

2.1. Early political structures and systems:
In its early stages, Igbo society was primarily organized around
autonomous village communities, known as autonomous
communities or "umunna." Each village was self-governing, with
its own political, social, and judicial systems. The village was

```
usually headed by a council of elders, comprising respected
individuals chosen based on their age, experience, and wisdom.
The political structure of the Igbo society was largely egalitarian,
with decision-making processes emphasizing consensus-building
and democratic principles. Important issues were discussed and
resolved through community meetings, where every adult member
had the opportunity to contribute. This participatory approach
allowed for a wide range of voices to be heard, and decisions were
often made through consensus rather than hierarchical authority
(Onwuatuegwu, I. N., 2020).
```
```
2.2. Emergence of Oha na Eze as a foundational concept:
Oha na Eze is a core principle in Igbo socio-political organization
and governance. Oha refers to the entire community or village,
while Eze means king or ruler (Onwuatuegwu, 2021). Oha na Eze
represents the collective will and authority of the people, wherein
the welfare of the community takes precedence over individual
interests.
The concept of Oha na Eze acknowledges the importance of
community participation in decision-making and the need for a
central authority figure to facilitate governance. The Eze, or king,
is seen as a custodian of the people's interests, responsible for
upholding justice, maintaining order, and representing the
community in external affairs.
The selection or appointment of an Eze was based on various
factors, including lineage, wisdom, leadership qualities, and the
ability to maintain harmony within the community. The Eze's
authority was not absolute but subject to the will and consent of the
people. In this sense, the Eze served as a symbol of unity and a
mediator between the community and the spiritual realm.
Oha na Eze played a crucial role in the Igbo socio-political system,
promoting social cohesion, conflict resolution, and collective
responsibility. This concept continues to hold significance in
contemporary Igbo society, even as external influences and modern
governance structures have evolved over time.
```
#### 3. Oha na Eze Overview ( Understanding

#### Oha na Eze)

```
Oha na Eze is a traditional concept in Igbo culture, which refers to
the relationship between the community (Oha) and the traditional
ruler (Eze). "Oha" is a term used to describe the community or
village, and "Eze" signifies the traditional ruler or king. Together,
Oha na Eze represents the symbiotic relationship and
interdependence between the community and its leader.
3.1. Core principles and values associated with Oha na
Eze:
Unity and Cooperation: Oha na Eze emphasizes the importance of
unity and cooperation among community members. It promotes the
idea that the community's progress and well-being are closely tied
to working together harmoniously. This is because through the
ages of man's development, one thing is sacrosanct and that is
man's interaction with one another (Onwuatuegwu, 2020).
Respect for Authority: The concept recognizes and upholds the
authority of the traditional ruler (Eze) as a symbol of the
community's identity and heritage. It entails respect for the Eze's
position, wisdom, and decisions.
Equity and Justice: Oha na Eze emphasizes fairness and justice
within the community. It promotes the idea that the traditional ruler
```

should govern with impartiality and ensure that all members of the
community are treated equitably.

Accountability and Responsibility: Both the Oha (community) and
the Eze (traditional ruler) have mutual obligations and
responsibilities. The community holds the Eze accountable for
providing effective leadership, while the Eze is responsible for
ensuring the welfare and development of the community.

Cultural Preservation: Oha na Eze recognizes the significance of
cultural heritage and its preservation. The Eze plays a vital role in
safeguarding and promoting the community's customs, traditions,
and values.

3.2. Roles and responsibilities of the Oha (community)
and Eze (traditional ruler):
3.2.1. Roles and Responsibilities of the Oha
(community)
Active participation: Community members are expected to actively
engage in communal activities, decision-making processes, and
development initiatives (Achebe, 1994). This participatory
approach fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility
within the community.

Support and loyalty: They are to show support and loyalty to the
Eze, recognizing the authority and leadership of the traditional
ruler (Hodgkins, 1986). This fosters social cohesion and facilitates
the smooth functioning of the community under the Eze's guidance.

Upholding cultural norms: Community members are responsible
for preserving and promoting the community's cultural heritage,
customs, and traditions (Okafor, 1987). This transmission of
cultural knowledge and practices across generations ensures the
continuity of the community's identity.

Contributing to the welfare of the community: Individuals within
the community are expected to contribute their skills, resources,
and efforts for the collective progress and well-being of the
community (Uzodinma, 2014). This collaborative spirit strengthens
the community and ensures its ability to meet challenges and
achieve shared goals.

3.2.2. Roles and Responsibilities of the Eze (traditional
ruler)
Leadership and governance: The Eze is responsible for providing
effective leadership, making decisions, and resolving disputes
within the community (Nwaorgu, 2016). Their leadership style is
often characterized by consultation and consensus-building (Mezie,
1999).

Maintenance of law and order: The Eze ensures the maintenance of
peace, security, and order within the community (Achebe, 1994).
Traditionally, this may involve a council of elders assisting the
Eze.

Promotion of development: The traditional ruler is expected to
promote the socio-economic development of the community,
initiate development projects, and attract investments (Okafor,
1987). The Eze often acts as a bridge between the community and
external actors, such as government agencies and potential
investors.

Preserving and promoting cultural heritage: The Eze plays a crucial
role in preserving and promoting the community's cultural heritage,
customs, and traditions (Uzodinma, 2014). This may involve
overseeing cultural events, supporting traditional institutions, and
advocating for the community's cultural identity.

```
Representation and diplomacy: The Eze represents the community
in interactions with other communities, government authorities,
and at cultural and traditional events (Hodgkins, 1986). They serve
as the voice of the community and act as a bridge between the
internal and external spheres.
It is important to note that the roles and responsibilities of the Oha
and Eze may vary to some extent across different Igbo
communities, as traditions and practices can differ slightly from
one community to another (Nwaorgu, 2016).
```
### 4. Oha na Eze as a Socio-political

### Framework (Governance and

### decision-making in the Igbo society)

```
In Igbo society, governance and decision-making are typically
based on a communal system known as "Oha na Eze." This
framework emphasizes the participation of the entire community in
the decision-making process, with the Eze (traditional ruler)
serving as a key figure (Nnoli, 1981).
4.1. Collective participation and consensus-building
Oha na Eze emphasizes collective participation and consensus-
building. The decision-making process involves gathering
members of the community, including elders, leaders, and
representatives, to discuss important matters. This ensures that
various perspectives are taken into account, and decisions are made
with the broader interests of the community in mind (Achebe,
1994). During these gatherings, individuals are encouraged to
express their opinions, share their expertise, and engage in debates.
The goal is to reach a consensus through dialogue, negotiation, and
the exchange of ideas. This inclusive approach fosters a sense of
ownership and collective responsibility among community
members (Uzodinma, 2014).
```
```
4.2. Role of the Eze as a custodian of tradition and
mediator
The Eze plays a crucial role in the Oha na Eze framework. As the
traditional ruler, the Eze is seen as the custodian of the
community's cultural heritage and traditions. They are responsible
for upholding and preserving the customs, values, and norms that
define the Igbo society (Afigbo, 1981).
Additionally, the Eze serves as a mediator in conflict resolution.
They help facilitate dialogue and reconciliation among community
members, striving to find mutually beneficial solutions. The Eze's
role as a neutral and respected figure allows them to mediate
disputes and maintain harmony within the community (Njoku,
1999). The Eze's authority is not absolute but is based on the
recognition and support of the community. They are expected to
lead with integrity, fairness, and wisdom, representing the
collective interests and aspirations of the people they serve
(Osuagwu, 2013).
The Oha na Eze framework embodies the democratic principles of
collective participation, consensus-building, and the preservation
of cultural heritage. It reflects the Igbo society's emphasis on
communal values, cooperation, and the pursuit of harmony and
justice.

5.1. Traditional rituals and ceremonies associated with
Oha na Eze
Selection Process: The Oha na Eze begins with the selection of a
new Eze. The process typically involves the kingmakers or the
council of elders who are responsible for identifying a suitable
candidate. Various factors, including lineage, character, and
leadership qualities, are taken into consideration (Hodgetts & Obi,
2000).

Crowning Ceremony: Once a suitable candidate is chosen, a
crowning ceremony is held to officially install the new Eze. This
ceremony is a significant event in the community and involves
elaborate rituals and celebrations. It often includes the symbolic
presentation of the Eze's staff of office, regalia, and other
traditional insignia of authority (Isiche, 1976).

Ancestral Invocation: Oha na Eze involves the recognition and
invocation of ancestral spirits during the installation ceremony.
Prayers and rituals are performed to seek the blessings and
guidance of the ancestors for the new Eze's reign (Mbanefo, 1981).

Feasting and Celebration: Oha na Eze is marked by feasting and
celebrations within the community. It is a time of unity and
rejoicing, where people come together to honor the new Eze and
show their support and loyalty (Uzodinma & Onwuejelu, 2012).

5.2. Case studies and examples illustrating the functioning
of Oha na Eze
5.2.1. Nri Kingdom
The Nri Kingdom in present-day Nigeria is known for its
adherence to Oha na Eze. The kingdom has a long history of
selecting and installing Ezes based on their ancestral lineage. The
Eze of Nri is considered a custodian of the community's traditions
and spiritual practices (Jeffreys, 1980). The Oha na Eze rituals and
ceremonies in Nri are still followed today, maintaining the cultural
and historical significance of the institution (Meek, 1977).

5.2.2. Umueri and Aguleri Conflict Resolution
In the Umueri and Aguleri communities of Anambra State,
Nigeria, the Oha na Eze played a vital role in conflict resolution.
These communities had a long-standing territorial dispute that led
to intermittent violence. To resolve the conflict, the traditional
rulers from both communities initiated an Oha na Eze process. The
Eze and other community leaders came together, performed rituals,
and invoked the ancestral spirits to guide the resolution process.
Through this traditional mechanism, the conflict was eventually
resolved, and peace was restored between the two communities
(Nwapa, 1977).

5.3. Ongoing relevance and adaptation of Oha na Eze in
modern times
Oha na Eze has evolved and adapted to the changing times while
still maintaining its core principles. Here are some examples of the
ongoing relevance and adaptation of Oha na Eze in modern times:

Community Leadership and Governance: The role of the Eze in
modern times extends beyond traditional rituals and ceremonies.
Ezes now play a crucial role in community leadership and
governance, working alongside elected officials to address local
issues and promote development (Okafor, 2017).

Cultural Preservation and Tourism: Oha na Eze ceremonies and
traditions have become important cultural events that attract
tourists and promote cultural preservation. Many communities
organize festivals and cultural showcases centered around the Oha

```
na Eze, creating awareness and appreciation for Igbo traditions
(Okpoko, 2012).
Mediation and Conflict Resolution: The Oha na Eze process
continues to be utilized for mediation and conflict resolution within
communities. Traditional rulers often serve as respected mediators,
helping to resolve disputes and maintain peace.
Symbol of Unity and Identity: Oha na Eze acts as a symbol of
unity and identity for the community. It serves as a reminder of
their shared heritage, values, and traditions, fostering a sense of
belonging and pride among community members.
Integration of Modern Practices: While Oha na Eze maintains its
traditional elements, it has also integrated modern practices to
adapt to the changing times. For example, Ezes now utilize
communication technologies to connect with community members,
promote development projects, and address issues more efficiently.
Community Development Initiatives: Ezes, as custodians of their
communities, actively participate in initiatives for community
development. They collaborate with government agencies, NGOs,
and other stakeholders to implement projects that improve
infrastructure, healthcare, education, and economic opportunities
within their domains.
Advocacy for Cultural Rights: Ezes, as traditional rulers, often
serve as advocates for the preservation and recognition of cultural
rights. They work towards safeguarding traditional practices,
languages, and customs, and ensure that the cultural heritage of
their communities is respected and protected.
Mentorship and Youth Empowerment: Ezes play a significant role
in mentoring and empowering the younger generation. They
provide guidance, promote education, and encourage the
preservation of cultural values among the youth. This ensures the
continuity of Oha na Eze and the community's traditions in the
future.
Admittedly, Oha na Eze continues to hold relevance in modern
times by combining tradition with adaptation. It serves as a
unifying force, promotes cultural preservation, resolves conflicts,
and contributes to community development, while also embracing
the changing needs and realities of the present era.
```
### 6. Challenges and Criticisms of Oha na

### Eze

```
6.1. Critiques of power dynamics and representation
within the system
Exclusionary nature: One of the main criticisms of Oha na Eze is
its tendency to exclude certain groups from power and
representation. Some argue that the system is inherently
hierarchical and privileges certain individuals or families based on
their lineage or social status (Onwuatuegwu, 2023). This can result
in the marginalization and exclusion of other groups within the
community, such as women or lower social classes.
Lack of democratic processes: Critics argue that Oha na Eze lacks
democratic processes and mechanisms for inclusive decision-
making. Power is often concentrated in the hands of a few
individuals or families, which can lead to an imbalance of power
and limited participation from the broader community (Egwuyenga
& Omale, 2020)
Gender inequality: Another criticism is the traditional gender roles
embedded within Oha na Eze. Women are often excluded from
```

```

```
##### 11

positions of power and decision-making, reinforcing gender
inequality within the system. This exclusion limits the perspectives
and contributions of women in community affairs (Egwuyenga &
Omale,2020)

6.2. Impact of colonialism and modernization on Oha na
Eze
Disruption of traditional structures: The colonial period and
subsequent modernization processes have had a significant impact
on Oha na Eze. The imposition of colonial rule often disrupted
traditional power structures and introduced new systems of
governance that challenged the authority of traditional rulers. This
has led to a loss of power and influence for some traditional leaders
and a weakening of the Oha na Eze system (Ahamefule, 2017)

Western influences and cultural erosion: Colonialism and
modernization also brought with them Western influences and
cultural changes that have affected the Oha na Eze system. Western
systems of governance and values have often clashed with
traditional practices, leading to a decline in the authority and
relevance of traditional rulers. Additionally, modernization and
urbanization have led to changes in social structures and values,
further eroding the traditional roles and practices associated with
Oha na Eze (Ahamefule, 2017).

6.3. Contemporary debates and discussions surrounding
the concept
Relevance in modern society: There are ongoing debates about the
relevance of Oha na Eze in contemporary society. Some argue that
the system is outdated and incompatible with modern democratic
principles, while others emphasize its cultural significance and the
need to preserve traditional institutions (Odumegwu-Ojukwu,
2023).

Balancing tradition and progress: Many discussions revolve around
finding a balance between preserving cultural heritage and
adapting to changing societal needs. Supporters of Oha na Eze
often advocate for preserving the traditional system, while critics
argue for incorporating more inclusive and democratic processes
(Ohaegbu, 2023).

Decentralization and local governance: Some debates focus on the
need for decentralization and greater local autonomy within the
Oha na Eze system. This includes discussions about empowering
local communities and ensuring broader representation and
participation in decision-making processes (Ohaegbu, 2023).

Obviously, the challenges and criticisms of Oha na Eze highlight
the need to address power dynamics, promote inclusivity, and
adapt the system to the changing realities of the modern world
while respecting cultural traditions.

### 7. Conclusion

Throughout this discussion, we have explored the concept of Oha
na Eze in the Igbo socio-political system. We have examined its
historical origins, its meaning, and its role in governance and
decision-making within Igbo communities. Oha na Eze represents
the collective authority of the people, and it embodies the
principles of unity, consensus, and communal responsibility. We
have also looked at the hierarchical structure of Oha na Eze, with
the Eze (king) at the top, followed by the Ndichie (elders) and the
Ndi Ozo (titleholders). These key points highlight the fundamental
aspects of Oha na Eze.

```
Oha na Eze holds significant importance in understanding the Igbo
socio-political system. It serves as a crucial institution that fosters
unity, cooperation, and communal decision-making among the
Igbo people. Igbo people have a communalistic style of life as
they live together in unity sharing things and responsibilities in
common (Onwuatuegwu, 2023). Oha na Eze provides a platform
for the expression of the collective will and aspirations of the
community. The individual is not considered as being isolated or
alienated from the society (Onwuatuegwu, 2022). It ensures that no
individual or group holds absolute power and that decisions are
made through consensus, taking into account the welfare and
interests of the entire community. Furthermore, Oha na Eze reflects
the Igbo principles of egalitarianism, as it values the opinions and
contributions of every member, regardless of social status.
Therefore, comprehending Oha na Eze is essential for grasping the
intricacies and values that underpin the Igbo socio-political system.
It is crucial to acknowledge that Oha na Eze is not a static
institution but rather a dynamic one that adapts to changing times
and circumstances. While its core principles remain steadfast, the
specific structures and practices within Oha na Eze may evolve
over time. In contemporary Igbo society, we observe variations in
the implementation of Oha na Eze due to factors such as
modernization, globalization, and individual community dynamics.
However, the fundamental significance of Oha na Eze persists, as it
continues to provide a framework for governance, conflict
resolution, and the preservation of Igbo cultural values.
In conclusion, Oha na Eze plays a vital role in the Igbo socio-
political system, embodying principles of unity, consensus, and
communal responsibility. Understanding Oha na Eze allows us to
appreciate the egalitarian nature of Igbo society, the importance of
collective decision-making, and the significance of community
cohesion. While Oha na Eze may evolve in its practices, its
underlying principles and continued relevance are a testament to its
enduring significance in Igbo culture.
