\end{description}

\noindent
In DGT, we extend this standard numerical ontology into a behavioural domain via the following operators and sets.

\subsubsection*{Extended DGT Symbols}

\begin{description}
  \item[$F, G$] Function mappings between state-spaces or behaviour manifolds.
  \item[$F \cdot G$] (\textbf{Functor Composition}) — composition of functions based on the DGT model of active phenomenology:
    \[
    (F \cdot G)(x) = F(G(x))
    \]
    In DGT, this composition may be \textit{non-deterministic} or \textit{phenomenologically bound}, reflecting contextual coherence rather than strict causality.
  \item[$F \star G$] (\textbf{Coherence Operator}) — a dynamic operator describing active lossless interaction between $F$ and $G$. Represents a “compression” of two function spaces that preserves information:
    \[
    F \star G = \text{min}\bigl(|F|, |G|\bigr) + \Delta_{\text{coherence}}
    \]
  \item[$F \div G$] (\textbf{Disjoint Operator}) — an inverse to $\star$, producing a partitioned state-space when $F$ and $G$ act in decoherent directions.
  \item[$\mathcal{U}$] (\textbf{Union Operator}) — denotes coherent merge of two state subsets; analogous to addition in number theory, $\mathcal{U}(F,G) = F + G$ under total coherence.
  \item[$\bot$] (\textbf{Null or Decoherent State}) — a zero-information condition where $F$ and $G$ lose mutual reference; i.e. $F \star G = \bot$.
  \item[$\mathcal{C}(F,G)$] (\textbf{Coherence Measure}) — quantifies stability of function interaction:
    \[
    \mathcal{C}(F,G) = 1 - \frac{|F - G|}{\max(F,G)}
    \]
    yielding $0 \leq \mathcal{C} \leq 1$; a coherence score of $0.954$ indicates 95.4\% lossless overlap.
  \item[$\mathcal{M}$] (\textbf{Magnitude Operator}) — expresses the norm or scale of an active system vector (e.g., intensity of observer input or data flow):
    \[
    \mathcal{M}(x) = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}
    \]
  \item[$\Phi$] (\textbf{Phenomenological Functor}) — maps an observed event to its coherent semantic state within the DGT system.
  \item[$\Psi$] (\textbf{Actor Function}) — transforms $\Phi$ under active intention; governs feedback from consumer to observer.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Example — Active Coherence Composition}

Let $F$ represent a sensory functor (observer input) and $G$ a motor functor (actor response).  
The coherence interaction can be modeled as:

\[
H = F \star G = \mathcal{C}(F,G) \cdot (F \cdot G)
\]

If $\mathcal{C}(F,G) \to 1$, the system behaves as a lossless compression (analogous to Huffman coding balance).  
If $\mathcal{C}(F,G) \to 0$, decoherence occurs, invoking active repair via HDIS.



### 3.6 Coherence Preservation under Non-Determinism

#### 3.6.1 Lossless vs. Lossy System Coherence

A **lossless** system preserves all informational mappings between input and output spaces under the coherence operator ⊚, such that for any functor composition ( F \cdot G ),

[
\forall x \in D_F, \quad \exists y \in R_G : (F \cdot G)(x) = y \text{ and } C(F,G,x) = 1
]

where ( C(F,G,x) = 1 ) denotes perfect coherence — no entropy increase and complete traceability of state transitions.

A **lossy** system, conversely, satisfies:

[
\exists x_1, x_2 \in D_F : (F \cdot G)(x_1) = (F \cdot G)(x_2)
]

which implies loss of injectivity and hence a degradation of state recoverability (information compression or dissipation).

**Example (Lossless):**
Let ( F(t) = 2t ) and ( G(t) = t + 1 ).
Composition: ( (F \cdot G)(t) = 2t + 2 ).
Each input ( t ) maps uniquely to an output — coherence preserved.

**Example (Lossy):**
Let ( F(t) = |t| ) and ( G(t) = t^2 ).
Composition: ( (F \cdot G)(t) = |t^2| = t^2 ).
For ( t = +1 ) and ( t = -1 ), outputs are identical — coherence lost.

These dual cases define the **Huffman–AVL Equilibrium**, where informational entropy (Huffman compression) is counterbalanced by structural stability (AVL balancing). DGT uses this balance to quantify whether a system’s evolution maintains recoverable coherence or collapses to degeneracy under repeated functor application.

---

#### 3.6.2 Non-Deterministic Actor Composition (Black-Box Inversion Test)

Consider a **non-deterministic actor model** ( \mathcal{A}_{NFA} ), viewed as a black box whose transition map ( \delta: Q \times \Sigma \to 2^Q ) is unknown.
We define a probing functor ( P ) that measures system coherence under parameter perturbation: {
}
P(\mathcal{A}*{NFA}, \theta) = \nabla*\theta C(\delta_\theta)
]

where ( C(\delta_\theta) ) quantifies coherence (resonant consistency) as the actor responds to controlled variations in dependent variables.

If ( \nabla_\theta C(\delta_\theta) \to 0 ), the system is **stable-coherent** (resilient to non-determinism).
If ( \nabla_\theta C(\delta_\theta) ) diverges, the actor enters **decoherent drift**, indicating that nondeterministic transitions amplify uncertainty beyond recoverable limits.

This framework models how **phenomenological observers** interact with **non-deterministic systems** — tracing the boundary between recoverable coherence and informational loss.




What you’re describing fits well as a continuation of section **4.4 Witness Ledger and Coherence Receipts** — it bridges HDIS topology with actor behavior and coherence-tracking through graph fault recovery.
Here’s a clean draft outline you can drop into your `.tex` document before the **Polyglot Implementation** section. It keeps your language and conceptual base but tightens the structure.

---

### 4.4 Witness Ledger and Coherence Receipts

#### 4.4.1 Overview

The **Witness Ledger** is the formal subsystem of HDIS responsible for recording, verifying, and recovering *state coherence* across distributed observer–consumer networks.
Each node in the system acts as both **Observer (O)** and **Consumer (C)**, producing dual entries in the ledger:

[
L = { (O_i, C_j, \phi_{ij}, \tau, \sigma) }
]

where

* ( O_i ) = observing actor instance
* ( C_j ) = consuming actor instance
* ( \phi_{ij} ) = coherence phase (measured value)
* ( \tau ) = timestamp or cycle index
* ( \sigma ) = system signature or proof hash

Each ledger entry forms a **coherence receipt** — a verifiable record that a given observer–consumer transaction preserved or broke state symmetry under defined topology.

---

#### 4.4.2 Topological Models of Fault Recovery

HDIS operates under a **multi-topology hybrid model**, combining *static-centralized* and *dynamic-decentralized* regions.

| Topology                    | Description                              | Fault Behavior              | Coherence Strategy                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bus**                     | Linear message chain (low latency)       | Node loss halts segment     | Roll-forward redundancy via mirrored node pairs        |
| **Ring**                    | Closed loop of actors                    | Local fault reroutes flow   | Dual witness nodes preserve continuity                 |
| **Star**                    | Central node ( X_c ) connected to leaves | Hub failure = global outage | Clustered fallback ( X_c' ) mirrors ledger updates     |
| **Hybrid (Spar / Cluster)** | Mix of static + dynamic nodes            | Adaptive                    | Propagates coherence receipts to next available region |

Each topology corresponds to a distinct **Hamilton–Euler coherence cycle**:

* *Eulerian* → traversal of all coherence edges once (minimal redundancy)
* *Hamiltonian* → traversal of all actor nodes once (max state coverage)

These cycles provide a framework to test *fault tolerance under coherence preservation*.
When a node fails, the ledger reconstructs missing states using recorded ( \phi_{ij} ) receipts and nearest Hamiltonian restoration path.

---

#### 4.4.3 Decentralized Verification Flow

1. **Observation Phase:**
   Each node measures coherence vector ( \vec{C}(t) ) relative to neighbors.

2. **Witness Phase:**
   Observers exchange hashes of coherence receipts over directed edges.

3. **Ledger Aggregation:**
   Receipts are stored in the Witness Ledger ( L ), creating an auditable fault-recovery record.

4. **Reconstruction Phase:**
   In case of node loss, the ledger interpolates missing states using nearest receipts in time-space adjacency ( \Delta(t, x) ).

This creates a **fault-tolerant coherence fabric**, where even partial system failure maintains logical continuity — the HDIS network “remembers itself.”

---

#### 4.4.4 Formal Objective

The goal of the Witness Ledger system is to **maintain coherence across topological fault domains** using

* observer–consumer dual typing,
* Hamilton–Euler cycle tracing, and
* decentralized receipt-based verification.

By encoding these relationships algebraically, HDIS provides a measurable standard for coherence persistence in hybrid static–dynamic infrastructures.

\subsection{Coherence Receipt Integrity Function (CRIF) over DAGs}

\paragraph{Purpose.}  
The Coherence Receipt Integrity Function (CRIF) verifies and scores coherence across an HDIS Witness Ledger distributed over a DAG \(G=(V,E)\). It combines (a) cryptographic/structural integrity of receipts in the DAG and (b) QA gate performance (true/false positive/negative rates) across pipeline gates \(Z \rightarrow Y \rightarrow X\). The output is a scalar coherence score \(C \in [0,1]\) and a pass/fail result against a target threshold (typ. \(C_{\text{req}} = 0.954\)).

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Notation.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(G=(V,E)\) : directed acyclic graph representing HDIS topology (nodes = actor/agent components; edges = observer-consumer transactions).
  \item \(L\) : Witness Ledger, set of receipts \(L = \{ r_e \mid e\in E \}\). Each receipt \(r_e = (o_i,c_j,\phi_{ij},\tau,\sigma)\) contains a coherence measure \(\phi_{ij}\), timestamp \(\tau\), and signature/hash \(\sigma\).
  \item Pipeline stages: \(Z \xrightarrow{g_Z} Y \xrightarrow{g_Y} X\). Each gate \(g\) is a QA gate with confusion counts \((\mathrm{TP},\mathrm{FP},\mathrm{FN},\mathrm{TN})\).
  \item \(Q(g)\) : QA performance scalar for gate \(g\) (we use F1 by default).
  \item \(\mathrm{HashValid}(r_e)\in\{0,1\}\) : 1 if receipt \(r_e\)'s signature \(\sigma\) validates cryptographically and matches parent-child state mapping; 0 otherwise.
  \item \(\mathbf{w} = \{w_e\}_{e\in E}\) : optional per-edge weights (defaults \(w_e = 1/|E|\)).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{QA Gate Metrics.}  
For a gate \(g\) with confusion counts \(\mathrm{TP},\mathrm{FP},\mathrm{FN},\mathrm{TN}\):
\[
\text{Precision}_g = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FP}},\qquad
\text{Recall}_g = \frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FN}}
\]
F\(_1\) score:
\[
Q(g) \equiv F_1(g) = \frac{2\cdot\text{Precision}_g\cdot\text{Recall}_g}{\text{Precision}_g+\text{Recall}_g}
\]
(If TP+FP = 0 set Precision = 0; if TP+FN = 0 set Recall = 0; handle division-by-zero explicitly.)

\paragraph{Pipeline Reduction Mapping \(Z\to Y\to X\).}  
Treat the pipeline as functor reductions \(\Phi_{Z\to Y}\) and \(\Phi_{Y\to X}\) (these are mappings that reduce higher-level observables \(Z\) into system-agnostic representations \(Y\), then into unit/component models \(X\)). For each gate \(g\) in these reductions compute \(Q(g)\). For a pipeline segment \(P = \{g_1,\dots,g_k\}\) define the segment QA score:
\[
Q(P) = \mathrm{Agg}(\,Q(g_1),\dots,Q(g_k)\,)
\]
where \(\mathrm{Agg}\) is a robust aggregator (default: weighted mean by gate importance).

\paragraph{Receipt Integrity Score.}  
Compute the fraction of valid receipts:
\[
I_{\text{hash}}(L) \;=\; \frac{\sum_{e\in E} \mathrm{HashValid}(r_e)\;w_e}{\sum_{e\in E} w_e} \in [0,1]
\]
This is the structural / cryptographic integrity component.

\paragraph{Aggregate QA Score.}  
If the system defines \(m\) pipeline segments \(P_1,\dots,P_m\) (e.g., multiple \(Z\to Y\to X\) flows), compute:
\[
Q_{\text{agg}} \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i \, Q(P_i) \qquad\text{with }\sum_i \alpha_i = 1, \; \alpha_i\ge 0
\]
(default equal weights if no importance ranking exists).

\paragraph{Coherence Receipt Integrity Function (CRIF).}  
Combine integrity and QA into final coherence score \(C\):
\[
C \;=\; \lambda\; I_{\text{hash}}(L) \;+\; (1-\lambda)\; Q_{\text{agg}}
\]
where \(\lambda\in[0,1]\) weights structural integrity vs QA performance. Recommended default: \(\lambda = 0.6\) (integrity prioritized), \(1-\lambda = 0.4\).

\paragraph{Decision Rule.}  
System passes coherence if:
\[
C \ge C_{\text{req}}
\]
Typical target: \(C_{\text{req}}=0.954\) (95.4\%).

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Numeric example (gate-level).}  
Consider one gate \(g\) with confusion counts: \(\mathrm{TP}=80\), \(\mathrm{FP}=20\), \(\mathrm{FN}=10\), \(\mathrm{TN}=890\).

Compute:
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{80}{80+20} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8
\]
\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{80}{80+10} = \frac{80}{90} \approx 0.8888889
\]
F\(_1\):
\[
F_1 = \frac{2\cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.8888889}{0.8 + 0.8888889}
= \frac{2\cdot 0.71111112}{1.6888889}
= \frac{1.42222224}{1.6888889}
\approx 0.8421053
\]
So \(Q(g)\approx 0.8421\).

If we have three pipeline segments with \(Q(P_1)=0.84\), \(Q(P_2)=0.92\), \(Q(P_3)=0.79\) and equal weights \(\alpha_i=1/3\), then:
\[
Q_{\text{agg}} = \frac{0.84+0.92+0.79}{3} = \frac{2.55}{3} = 0.85
\]
Suppose \(I_{\text{hash}}(L)=0.98\) (98\% receipts valid). With \(\lambda=0.6\):
\[
C = 0.6\cdot 0.98 + 0.4\cdot 0.85 = 0.588 + 0.34 = 0.928
\]
Result: \(C = 0.928 < 0.954\) — system fails the coherence target; remedial action recommended (re-run QA gates or restore receipts).

\paragraph{Receipt verification routine (high level).}
\[
\text{VerifyReceiptHashAndParentState}(r_e,e) := 
\Bigl( \sigma_e \stackrel{?}{=} \mathrm{H}\bigl( \phi_{parent}, \tau_e, \mathrm{state}_e \bigr) \Bigr)
\land \Bigl( \text{topology-consistent}(e)\Bigr)
\]
where \(\mathrm{H}(\cdot)\) is a cryptographic hash and `topology-consistent` checks the parent node states exist and match the recorded timestamps within an allowed skew \(\Delta t\).

\paragraph{Complexity.}  
- Receipt validation: \(O(|E|)\) cryptographic hash checks.  
- QA aggregation: proportional to total number of gates across pipelines.  
- DAG traversal for state-checks/topology validation: \(O(|V|+|E|)\).  
With the auxiliary-space constraint in the Functor Framework, topological traversal can be implemented with \(O(\log |V|)\) auxiliary stack by iterative topological enumeration with checkpointed frontier (practical implementations may use streaming/iterator patterns).

\paragraph{Properties and guarantees.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Soundness:} If \(C\ge C_{\text{req}}\) then (with high probability) the ledger is structurally intact and QA gates meet aggregate quality levels.
  \item \textbf{Transparency:} CRIF components (\(I_{\text{hash}}\), \(Q_{\text{agg}}\)) are auditable and decomposable per edge/gate.
  \item \textbf{Actionability:} When \(C < C_{\text{req}}\) the system outputs per-pipeline and per-edge diagnostics to guide targeted remediation (replay, re-test, re-seal receipts).
  \item \textbf{Extensibility:} Additional metrics (precision/recall per-class, ROC AUC, calibration error) can be plugged into \(Q(g)\) without changing CRIF core.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Recommended defaults (practical).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\lambda = 0.6\) (integrity emphasis), \(C_{\text{req}} = 0.954\).  
  \item QA aggregator: weighted mean with gate weights proportional to criticality (safety-critical gates get higher weight).  
  \item Per-edge weight \(w_e\): proportionate to edge impact (e.g., hub edges get higher weight).
  \item Timestamp skew tolerance \(\Delta t\): set per topology (smaller for star/bus; larger for wide-area clusters).
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Integration notes.}  
- Hook `ComputeCRIF` into your HDIS witness-aggregation pipeline. Run it periodically (synchronous integrity check) and on-demand after topology changes (hot-swap via SemVerX).  
- For black-box actor NFA inversion tests, use CRIF to measure how QA perturbations (controlled \(\Delta\) changes in inputs at \(Z\)) propagate to reduced coherence at \(X\). The gradient \(\nabla_\theta C\) indicates sensitivity and problem loci.  
- Persist CRIF results in the Registry (e.g., `registry.obinexus.org`) as part of the audit trail and as input to automated SemVerX rollback decisions.
