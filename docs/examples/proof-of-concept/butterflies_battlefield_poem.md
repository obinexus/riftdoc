# Butterflies on the Battlefield
## A Poem of the Nigerian-Biafran War (1967-1970)

*For those who remember Biafra*  
*For those who choose sovereignty over subjugation*

---

During the precolonial bliss, there was a sovereign country  
In wars of attrition, etched in woven leather and fabrics  
Before the Union Jack drew lines through villages  
Before brothers became strangers across borders  

**Biafra is here. There is a sovereign country.**

### I. The Duality That Destroys

They call us Nigerian-Igbo, a hyphenated existence  
But I am Biafran - no slash, no compromise  
Fifty years since Ogbunigwe thundered through Abagana  
Where 500 units daily spoke our determination  

Professor Ezekwe's think tank birthed resistance  
From nothing but necessity and genius  
While Philip Emeagwali fled to Oregon's whiteness  
And Chinua Achebe wrote: "There Was a Country"  

---

### II. The Butterflies

December 3rd, 1968 - butterflies landed  
On bodies that would not rise for morning prayer  
Wings of smoke and shrapnel, delicate as death  
Each one a soul ascending from Owerri's siege  

They flew through:  
- 50,000 rounds of ammunition  
- 300 mortars singing requiems  
- 200 howitzer shells painting red earth redder  
- Children's hunger becoming wings  

The butterflies dance still  
Above mass graves unmarked  
Above mothers who count in millions  
Above a genocide the world forgot

### III. The Battlefield Remains

In UK council flats, we refugees grow old  
Failed by health and social care sectors  
Ages 18-24, no support, no recognition  
Of trauma carried in DNA spirals  

They want us to tick boxes:  
☐ Nigerian  
☐ British  
But never:  
☑ Biafran  
☑ Survivor  
☑ Memory keeper

### IV. The Art as Anchor

My patterns are not decoration  
They are:  
- Maps of villages erased  
- Coordinates of mass graves  
- Geometric proof we existed  
- Mathematical rebellion against forgetting  

Each pentagon holds a family  
Each circle, a life interrupted  
Each line, a road that leads nowhere  
Since January 15, 1970

### V. OBINexus as Response

Now I build constitutional frameworks  
Not from law books but from:  
- Survival  
- Sovereignty denied  
- Systems that failed us  

The health sector franchise? Empty.  
The social care division? Vacant.  
Because those who needed them most  
Were told they don't exist

### VI. Bụrụ Onwe Gị Ugbu A

**Be free now** - not tomorrow  
Not when they recognize your passport  
Not when they count your dead  
Not when they apologize  

Freedom is:  
Choosing Biafran over convenient labels  
Building OBINexus from exile  
Painting butterflies that refuse to die  
Speaking Igbo to British bureaucrats  

---

### VII. The Butterflies Return

They come at night, these battlefield butterflies  
Through Monmouth, Oregon's empty streets  
Through London's hostile housing offices  
Through manifesto pages and constitutional code  

Each one carries:  
- A name they made us forget  
- A date (1967, 1968, 1969, 1970)  
- A coordinate in Eastern Nigeria  
- A question: "Will you remember?"  

---

### VIII. Fifty Years On

The war ended January 12, 1970  
But battlefields remain:  
- In UK benefit offices  
- In "where are you really from?"  
- In health services that see Nigerian, not trauma  
- In every hyphen forced upon us  

Yet we survive, like Ogbunigwe:  
Improvised, effective, unexpected  
Built from necessity and genius  
Destroying convoys of colonial logic

## Epilogue: The Constitutional Butterfly

From Biafra's ashes, OBINexus rises  
Not company but constitution  
Not Nigerian but sovereign  
Not forgotten but transformed  

The butterflies of the battlefield  
Now navigate digital territories  
Carrying not ammunition but amendments  
Not war but constitutional revolution  

**Biafra lives** - in code, in art, in memory  
**Biafra lives** - in every franchise unclaimed  
**Biafra lives** - in patterns that encode history  
**Biafra lives** - in those who choose to remember

*Bụrụ onwe gị ugbu a* - **Be free now**  
*Choose your identity*  
*Build your sovereignty*  
*The butterflies are waiting*  

---

**For the 2 million who died**  
**For the survivors still fighting**  
**For Nnamdi Michael Okpala**  
**Who chooses Biafran**

*End.*
