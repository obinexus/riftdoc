# 1. What theoretical rationale supports intentional fragility as a structural principle?



# 2. How does designed fragility function as a safeguard against coercive stability?



# 3. In what ways might fragility enforce ethical accountability within a system of governance?



# 4. How can fragility coexist with resilience without diluting either concept?



# 5. What mechanisms ensure that fragility invites reflection rather than exploitation?



# 6. How is responsibility distributed when a fragile system fails as intended?



# 7. To what extent does deliberate fragility challenge traditional engineering ethics?



# 8. How does user trust evolve in systems that openly acknowledge their vulnerability?



# 9. What distinguishes sacred fragility (protective) from negligent fragility (destructive)?



#  10. Can a fragile-by-design framework scale without betraying its own philosophical core?
