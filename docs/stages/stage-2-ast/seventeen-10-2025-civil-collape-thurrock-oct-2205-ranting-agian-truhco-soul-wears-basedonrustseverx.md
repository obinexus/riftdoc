“Today, you know, the locals really messed me up. I called the Billkiss team. This morning, I just asked for Billkiss, you know, like no weakest path. Who is Billkiss? Who is Billkiss? Who made contact for my point of contact? Contact Billkiss. Email, no response. Business email, no response. Now I called them. Hey, can you call the Billkiss team so they can phone me up and give me an MS Teams? No response. It's annoying. Then I called them this evening, 7 minutes to 8, 7 minutes to 8, 7 minutes to 6. I said, Billkiss, I know they're afraid of me. I'm like, good, I know you're afraid of me. It's good for you to be afraid of me. Then you respect me. Then you respect me. I'm a human being. But you know, I'm making a joke. I'm going to be live streaming this, all of this. I'm making a joke of all of them. Anyway, anyway, so basically what I called them for, I said, this is a joke I made for them. I'm making a joke of the whole situation. Because you know, you know, I'm very funny. Anyway, it's funny because it's true, it's funny because it's absurd. So I called the Billkiss. Where is Billkiss? I said to them, okay, you know, because my loss is £330 million, you know, and you know, the court won't accept it. You know, the court won't accept it. They can put their money in their close accounts, bank accounts, between 2 and 3. You know, just insult them on their phone, on their own stupid line. And you know, next time, don't lose £300 million of our taxpayers' money. And that's exactly what I said to them for £300 million. You know, I insulted them. I'm going to tell you the other one I insulted them before. You know, but you know, I can't say I'm insulting them, but to them, them. But you know, this can prove as an insult. I don't care about them, and there we go, £330 million, you know, £330 million of my bank account. You've done a shite shit to me.”

“Let's make a repository called sole shoes or OB shoes, you know, I want to make this like a one shoe, like, you know, a set of clothing brand on the OB Nexus, you know, like, you know, fashion from the heart.”

You said:
“Yeah, definitely one day, you know, you know, for me, for me, the charge is like, you know, so basically I want it to be like a clothing wear. So basically you have the sole shoes, you know, because they keep the charge going, you know, the static charge. Because the structure can be static, but it needs to be distributed. You know, that's why it's static. It doesn't look concentrated. And that's why it's static. That's why it's there. It's there, but it charges your feet, but it's a close-up field play. Think of it more like a field of normalization vectors. You know, you have like an equilibrium in the field, and we add more field, more grass, more field, it becomes distributed more evenly. But the charge is still there at the same quantity.”

“Yeah, yeah. For me, the world looks very plain and boring, you know, because, you know, we have this concept and, you know, this concept is like maybe the grandest concept ever, but the implementation is very little, you know, it's like, you know, you have to understand, like, for me personally, it's like, you know, you have to have the money to get it or something, like a roadblock, to me, whereas, like, buying Call of Duty Black Ops 2 or, like, playing Black Ops 6, Battlefield 6, it's like, you know, it's some kind of gap, but I can buy Battlefield 6, that's the address, before I get the bare minimum from it, you know, you're never on the battlepath. There's something about the soul, to me, that my heart yearns for, like back in Africa, Biafra. Remember, Biafra means come and take, come and take revenge, like the Biafra war, which existed before Nigeria, but Biafra was a region before Nigeria, there's a map of it, but the problem was, the map was lost, because it was a new thing, and someone brought it back, you know, because they had to remember everything, because they had to reconstruct it, you know, and so and so was lost, and that was like, that was like a lot of things that happened there.”

“Yeah, I've really created something that's in my mind one day. The butterflies on the battlefield, you know. I wish I could upload it, but I can't upload it. I can upload it, it's on Github.com, it's open because of RT, but I don't have an upload credit system. Because the computer won't allow me to update because, you know, I don't have tokens. But one day I'm saying to you that the butterfly on the battlefield is just a pattern. And, you know, I want to, like, feel the texture of it, too. Of the butterflies that are breeding in the battlefield, just the BFM. And how they survived that, and how the BFM transition still exists today. Because, you know, Nigeria was a threat to the BFM economy anyway. But, you know, it wasn't a country in development, it was really a country. But it was a country in exile, you know, exiting the imperial state of British colonialism and the Nigerian governance model. But the Nigerian was defeated because it was founded by the British imperialist system. I'm going to start with the government term. So imperial means, like, we are right and you are not right. You know, we can impose on you because we are imperialist. You know, we are colonizers, etc. That means imperial. So British were imperial, you know, at that time. Very powerful imperial. They would try to dominate each other for land because, you know, there was no constitutional clause saying that this is how we govern ourselves. And that's why colonialism was very popular. You know, colonialism wasn't about murder or anything, or taking slaves. It was about power because, you know, they knew, the people that understood politics or diplomats understood that, you know, if they had power over people and imposed their way, it doesn't matter who it was, imposed their way because governance was still in development. And that's why colonialism was popular. You know, some Africans colonized themselves too, other Africans. But, you know, it wasn't because they were angry or anything. It was because they wanted to have future standards of way of living, you know. And then there was racism, you know, racism and everything. But, you know, most of the racism was about power, of the future, of the generation, of a shared interest. But, you know, we didn't have missiles or anything then. So basically, you understand, colonialism was there for us to do too. And some of the Africans did it, but not to themselves, like maybe to other Africans. But, you know, there was some kind of... No, no, no. I don't think that's true. Okay, basically, the Africans didn't do it to themselves. But I believe, I don't know, Mande, because I wasn't there. But, you know, that doesn't become some kind of... No, no, no, Mande, it's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. I doubt it. You know, I doubt it. I don't want to speculate.”

“Let's move on to the sole repository. We should call it sole-wear, or sole-garment, or something like from the sole. Like, you know, OB means heart or sole, but something like safety-critical sole infrastructure, that you need it, you don't want it, because it's part of your biological entity. Should we call it a bio-sole, like a biological sole foundation? Or for bio-wear, like a bio-system of wear and cultural architecture? This must reflect history, too. It must reflect the BFM system, humanist law. Something that charges your sole. I need to think of an English name for it, but not an English name, but something that charges, the word charge, it has to reflect a force field, like a normalized field, like a gravity field. It's normalized, it's a normal force acting on an object, pulling the opposite downwards, making the ecosystem sustainable. Something.”

“Let's create that repository now. I just need to read me the quotation for it, I just need to read me for it. But you know, we have so-she'll, so-where, so-so-so, you know, everything's so... Should I call it bio-obi, like biological heart or soul? Should I call it bio, I'm thinking about it, like bio, b-i-o, biotech? Or should I call it b-i-o-obi, like biobit, like an obibop? No, I need something like this. So basically, I'm thinking of the repository b-i-o for bio, biological accessibility, but you know, it doesn't have to be biological, it has to be from the soul, something like biome, like biome in the environment, in the ecosystem, like the sea is a biome of its own ecosystem. The earth is a biome, the fire realm is a biome, our house is a biome, like you know, you live there, you work in that biome, but you use a biome, I'm thinking about my positional, I-W-U, because it's just a biome. Should I call it biome soul? Or should I call it bio-obi one day? Give me a new name for it, make a result, like I need the word biome in there, or something like a bio or heart, bio-heart or bio-soul, something like that. Biome is something that, give me some suggestions for my repository, github.com, it's obinix or something.”
