Dear Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State,

Thank you for the response to our previous report, and for confirming the appointment of
Denise Murray as Finance Commissioner. In your response, you requested that our next
report provides an assessment with evidence of the extent to which Thurrock Council is
meeting the Best Value Duty. The statutory intervention in Thurrock Council is due to end on
1 September 2025. With this in mind, this report provides our view as Commissioners on the
Council’s current position and what further support may be required beyond this date.

Our recent reports have outlined the significant progress the Council has made to date. Taking
into account the further improvements since our last report was submitted in November 2024,
this report uses the Best value standards and intervention: a statutory guide for best value
authorities published in May 2024 to assess whether and in which areas Thurrock Council is
now meeting its Best Value Duty or still failing to do so.

Since our last report was submitted, the Government has published the English Devolution
White Paper and the Greater Essex area, including Thurrock Council, has subsequently been
confirmed on the Devolution Priority Programme and invited to submit proposals for local
government reorganisation (LGR). Both of these major transformation programmes provide
significant opportunities for Thurrock Council and its residents. However, we would highlight
that it is vital that the Council retains its focus and commitment to improvement despite these
other pressures, and ensures it has the leadership vision and capacity in place to drive forward
all three of these significant programmes simultaneously. Furthermore, it is important that any
LGR proposals that come forward will be able to demonstrate that they contribute positively to
the future financial sustainability of any new unitary authority that includes the existing
Thurrock Council.

Executive Summary

Since the beginning of the intervention in September 2022, the Council has engaged positively
with Commissioners and taken seriously its commitment to recovery and improvement.
Progress within the first year was limited, due primarily to a long period of financial discovery
with regular movements in the Council’s understanding of its true financial position. This was
combined with a significant limitation in organisational capacity impacting its ability to move at
pace in terms of organisational improvement.

The Administration continues to own the recovery agenda and is taking steps to reengage
with its communities through a series of initiatives including open “town hall” style events,
campaigns such as “A fresh start for Thurrock” and “Thurrock Cares,” as well as community


action at Coalhouse Fort and a localisation pilot. Whilst this is welcomed and is encouraged,
there is still a lot of work to do to rebuild trust between the Council and its communities. This
is set against a backdrop of further years of very difficult political decisions that will need to be
taken to reduce the structural debt that the Council has.

The additional pressure of LGR could distract politicians from focussing on the necessary
recovery work, but to date they have stood firm on their recovery efforts; this is despite
considerable broader political pressure surrounding LGR within Greater Essex. To support the
continuous development of the Council’s political leadership, LGA-supported political
mentoring for Cabinet is underway, both for individual Portfolio Holders and for Cabinet as a
collective group, and Commissioners would encourage Members to fully embrace this
opportunity.

With enhanced financial leadership capacity, much good work has been done to address
historic financial accounts and governance issues. However, there are still a number of open
posts across finance and the system of internal controls that have proven difficult to fill, and
inevitably this could hamper further progress.

The Council was able to set a balanced budget for the 2025/ 2 6 fiscal year, but it could not
have done so without Exceptional Financial Support (EFS) facilitated by government. The
2025/26 Budget highlighted that there remains a structural deficit of £ 8 million and that the
overall debt position is estimated to rise to over £ 1.1billion by the end of 2025/26. Tackling
this financial problem will require tough political decisions in the future over service choices
and an ambitious but well considered and resourced transformation plan.

There remains a weakness in the authority’s approach to risk management and it has not yet
been embraced across the Council as an essential organisational capability. Additionally, the
capacity pressures across Internal Audit means that this is an area that remains
underdeveloped, with a limitation of audit scope for 2024/25, although a 3 - year Internal Audit
plan has now been produced.

Capacity remains a significant issue for Thurrock Council. Whilst some progress has been
made around efficiency, this will not be enough to strategically reshape the Council to ensure
it becomes fit for the future, whether it continues to stand alone or is merged into a larger
unitary through LGR. In part, this could be achieved through implementing in full its proposed
operating model, although this is still underdeveloped, and it is crucial that this now progresses
at pace. A new operating model should be the catalyst for an ambitious transformation plan
and the Council has taken the view that it needs to access some external strategic capacity to
support with its implementation and to build an impactful transformation plan. To ensure that
the Council can secure and manage a strategic partnership of this nature, it will need to invest
in its contract management capability. Any contract will need to specify the Council’s
requirement clearly, to ensure that it is able to secure Value for Money from its chosen partner.

Despite ongoing good work, the Council is still some way from achieving its Best Value Duty
and it will take time for the improvements to become sustainable and part of the organisational
culture. Achieving Best Value cannot be a “moment in time” but enough strength, depth and
cultural change will be needed to ensure changes are deeply embedded and cannot easily be
rolled back. There are still too many areas of fragility in the Council’s recovery and still some
major areas of work yet to be done. It is our view that the Council has not yet sufficiently
demonstrated that it has the capacity and capability to sustain its own journey of continuous
improvement without external involvement. For this reason and referring to evidence within
this report, Commissioners are recommending that the Minster should consider extending the
length of the intervention beyond September 2025 and that there should be a phased


approach to refining the model and winding down the intervention over this period. The
Minister may wish to consider whether any period of extension to intervention should be
aligned to the LGR timetable.

The Council’s Leadership capability, both politically and managerially, has improved
throughout the intervention and Commissioners are of the view that the Managing Director
Commissioner (MDC) model has been invaluable in creating the drive and focus for
improvement. However, as part of this phased approach, there will be a time when it would be
appropriate for the Council to recruit its own full time Chief Executive and move away from the
MDC model. If the Minister is minded to extend the intervention period beyond September
2025, Commissioners would recommend that a timeline should be agreed where the Council
recruits its own Chief Executive at which point the MDC role ceases, factoring in time for a
smooth transition during this period. The Minster will also wish to consider the timing of this
change in line with any possible decisions around LGR.

The remainder of this report is structured around the seven Best Value themes and provides
evidence of progress and areas of work still needed. Appendix 1 also provides an assessment
against the Directions. This outlines our view that while work is ongoing in the specified areas,
none the Directions have yet been achieved in full.

Leadership

Poor leadership and a destructive culture were at the root of the failings at Thurrock Council,
and it is pleasing to be able to report that there has been much improvement in this area, both
politically and organisationally. Relationships between senior officers and Members have
generally become more mutually respectful and collaborative.

During the early days of the intervention, it was clear that there was a significant issue around
the political maturity of some Members in terms of their understanding of their stewardship
roles and how to interact effectively with officers. This was in part compounded by poor quality
reports from officers and a lack of transparency where information was, in some
circumstances, withheld from Members. Whilst there have been significant improvements
through, for example, more collaborative relationships between members and officers as well
as a training offer for officers to improve the quality of reports, the Council’s political and
organisational leadership must continue to model the right behaviours and call it out where it
falls short. We have had constructive discussions with the political leadership on this point
who have committed to treat this as a priority and have demonstrated this in recent months.

Following a period of some stability across the political leadership, since our last report, the
leaders of the two largest parties have now stepped down from their roles and a new Leader
of the Council will be confirmed at the Annual Council meeting in May. We would like to thank
both Cllr John Kent and Cllr Andrew Jeffries for their positive engagement with Commissioners
and the improvements made during their time as Leaders of the Council. While this creates
some initial instability, a change in political leadership over time is a routine process for a
political organisation, and not necessarily an indicator of Best Value failure. However, we
would expect to see the organisation deliver a smooth and seamless transition to the new
leadership arrangements and the new Leaders to continue driving forward the necessary
improvement activity at pace. Cllr Lynn Worrall has just been elected as the new Leader of
the Labour Group whilst the new Leader of the Opposition Group, Cllr George Coxshall, has
been in post since March. We have worked closely with both in their role as Deputy Leaders
of their respective parties and have seen evidence of their determination and commitment to
recovery through their inputs at our commissioner chaired Recovery Boards. We will want to


see them providing the strong, effective, collaborative and transformative leadership required
for this next phase.

The Cabinet have been engaging positively with a programme of individual and team
mentoring provided through the LGA, and Commissioners strongly support this work to
continue to strengthen the political leadership of the Council. This is particularly important as
there are more difficult political decisions to be made both now and in the future which will
require strong leadership and resilience from a collegiate and effective Cabinet.

In terms of organisational capacity, the Council approved a new leadership structure in August
2023 which has facilitated investment in corporate capacity and capability. Most recruitment
to this new structure has taken place through late 2023 and early 2024. Since that time, with
an increase in capacity and fresh ideas, there has been an upturn in the pace and breadth of
improvement. The initial Best Value Inspection (BVI) report highlighted the lack of joined up
strategic leadership at the Council resulting in a siloed organisation. With a new cadre of senior
officers and with a now enhanced Senior Leadership Team (SLT), it is important that the
Council continues to spend time investing in both SLT and the wider cohort of leaders, so that
they are able to offer more collegiate leadership to the organisation. Work with the Leadership
Centre focused on this has been fruitful to date. SLT have been working effectively together
in recent months, taking a more cohesive, corporate approach to discussions, with recent
changes in personnel continuing to have positive impacts. This team development work has
recently started to broaden out to include the next two tiers of leadership and this is to be
encouraged. Learning together as a broader leadership cohort will help sustain and power
further necessary improvement across the Council.

A recent staff survey reflected signs of increasing trust between the senior leadership and
officers, although it also reflected that there was still more work to do. Importantly, the Council
needs to clarify its action plans in this area and report progress back to staff, a very important
step in building future trust across the whole organisation.

The MDC model has played an important role in the Council’s progress since its
implementation. It has helped to create a greater sense of collaboration between
Commissioners and the organisation and has contributed to creating a sense of momentum.
For Thurrock, and for other interventions using this model, there is a broader question around
when may be an appropriate point within the intervention for this model to come to an end.
From the Commissioners’ perspective in Thurrock, as the Council continues to make
significant recovery progress at pace and as it further embeds these improvements, there will
need to be a time when it should revert to a more traditional Chief Executive model. The
Minster will want to give some thought as to the best time for this to be considered in Thurrock
in light of upcoming decisions on LGR. Commissioners would recommend that there is enough
time ahead of this change in the model of intervention to enable a smooth transition between
the MDC and a Chief Executive.

Use of resources/financial sustainability

The Council has continued an appropriate pace of progress since the last report and
increasing identification and grip on the risks embedded with the historic accounts, financial
strategy and associated budget delivery. This gives Commissioners a degree of confidence
that with the continued strong leadership and the right capacity in finance, improvements can
be built on and sustained.

The Council is making good progress on improving financial management and oversight. To
ensure transparency and accountability in its operations, regular reporting has been
established, communication of clear financial goals, detailed budget build, active cash flow


monitoring and an update of the financial regulations and scheme of delegation underway.
However, the Council must ensure that the financial management, reporting and regulation
arrangements in place, to govern the strategic and operational management of its budgets,
investments, funding, assets and companies, are in accordance with CIPFA’s Financial
Management Code.

Steps have been taken to further develop and strengthen the models that underpin the key
financial strategies such as the Medium-Term Financial Strategy, Capitalisation Direction,
asset disposal, divestment and debt & servicing costs. This has resulted in revisions to the
Council’s estimated level of Capitalisation Direction, with an increase from £520million (2024)
to £691million in the latest iteration. With appropriate use of specialist expertise and
independent assurance when needed, the Council continues to pursue asset sales which will
become more challenging as it transitions to its operational estate, deliver its divestment
strategy and pursue litigation where appropriate and in the interests of their residents. The
Council will need to ensure the assumptions are sufficiently robust and where necessary
sensitivity tested to assess the Council’s resilience to variations, flexibility to adapt to changing
circumstances and facilitate informed future decision-making.

The Council has published its statement of accounts for the four financial years 2020/21 to
2023/24. However, until an outstanding material objection on the 2020/21 accounts is
resolved, these historic accounts will remain open. The delays in the conclusion of the historic
accounts and open Value for Money work relating to these historic periods will have a knock-
on risk for the 2024/25 audit and current / future years accounts. The Council will need to be
proactive in their engagement with the external auditors, in the development of an audit plan
which seeks to minimise the ongoing risks and uncertainty and ascertain early the auditors’
view on policies such as Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) and judgements, where complex
estimates and subjective evaluations are involved.

In view of the above, the estimated CD of £691million is subject to no further adverse
discoveries or material changes to the assumptions being required by the external auditors.

The 2025/26 budget was passed by Council at its meeting in February and included £18million
of savings, efficiencies and income generation. The budget was balanced with £72million of
Exceptional Financial Support from the government, £64m of which is attributed to debt
servicing costs and £8m contribution to the annual operational deficit. There is a robust internal
governance process in place for tracking and reporting savings progress against targets and
identifying alternatives as may be required. In the previous financial year, the Council has
demonstrated the effectiveness of this process and its good track record of delivering savings.
However, many of the savings are tactical in nature, streamlining processes or cutting
spending on specific items within a department, and options for further savings of this nature
will be limited.

The medium-term financial strategy forecast the financial landscape facing the Council to
2028/29 (after the application of CD as outlined above, and 100% delivery of 2025/26 budget
assumptions) a budget gap or recurrent savings requirement rising to £41million. This
represents more than 20% of the Council’s core spending power and an ambitious savings
target for an authority of this size. The Council is due to commence the rolling refresh of its
medium-term financial strategies, which will need to reconcile the ambitions set out in the
Corporate Plan, operating model and full elimination of the operational deficits. Given the scale
of the financial challenge, the Council will need to accelerate and resource its transformation
programme, adopting a ‘One Council’ approach with collaboration between different
departments, services, and partner organisations to deliver a fundamental rethinking of how
services are provided and operating costs sustainably reduced.


The ring-fenced accounts should not be overlooked. Local authority housing is under severe
financial pressures with the need to address investment into the existing stock, increased
regulatory requirements, continued need for new affordable homes, and preparing a robust,
affordable and fully stress tested HRA 30-year Business Plan has never been more important.
In addition, the scale of the forecasted Dedicated Schools Grant deficit will require the
development of a long-term plan in conjunction with stakeholders, partners and government
departments to demonstrate how local need (current and projected) will be met and how the
Council plans to recover the local deficit incurred over the medium to long term.

The view of the Council’s long-term sustainability remains unchanged. Whilst good progress
continues to be made on the financial levers within the Council’s control and the Council is
taking its responsibility seriously by reducing its debt, with the scale of the residual debt and
associated servicing costs, it will not be able to achieve sustainability without significant
Government support. This has been a consistent position since early in the intervention.
Commissioners will continue to work with government to explore further options to support the
Council towards long-term sustainability.

The proportion of the Council’s net revenue expenditure which is spent on demand driven
services, such as adults and children’s social care and homelessness, is 60 % in 2025/
increasing over the three years of the MTFS to 67%. This leaves less flexibility for the Council
to manage debt servicing costs which are typically fixed and potentially hindering the ability to
meet future financial constraints.

Benchmarking and comparisons with other councils needs to be further developed in the year

- understanding local need and demand for key council services, costs and how demographic
and other activity changes are impacting this. Exploring whether the Council is making the
best use of scarce resources when redesigning services and the maximum debt service cost
as a portion of the Council’s net revenue budget that can be realistically sustained.

Skills capability and capacity **_–_** recruitment & succession planning

The current focus of the Council is understandably on several key strands, devolution to
Essex, LGR and journey to a sustainable and resilient best value authority in a changing local
government financial landscape. Building the right capacity across the Council to optimise the
opportunities and manage the risks will be critical. It will be necessary to ensure that the
discipline of credible resource planning is consistently applied across key functions to provide
a clear roadmap for how and when resources will be used, minimising delays and costs and
enabling better evidenced based decision-making. The Council will need to ensure that
recruitment is prioritised to address skills and capacity gaps, provide resilience, and specialist
expertise where it is needed.

Performance Management

There are clearly some examples of high-performance culture within the organisation, as
evidenced by the recent Ofsted rating of “outstanding for Children’s Services,” a huge
achievement for a council under intervention and in fiscal distress. However, there is
considerable inconsistency across the Council.

A new Corporate Plan has provided organisational focus but despite some recent good
development work towards a new Council wide approach, employee performance
management remains weak in many places across the authority which could reduce the
impact of the Corporate Plan. A performance management framework and new business
planning guidance have been introduced this year, which aim to better integrate financial and


service planning together with a more rigorous review of performance by officers and
members.

Governance

This is an area where we have seen significant progress since the start of the intervention.
Work continues at pace on improving governance at the Council, although we still have
concerns that arrangements are not yet sufficiently robust across internal controls, risk
management and audit. The organisation also needs to fully embrace the difference between
Cabinet and Council meetings and to rebalance the focus of discussions, ensuring that
Cabinet is the locus of decision-making within the Council. This will be a core element of the
Council’s revised Constitution.

Members and officers have been engaged on the Constitution review which was due to be
completed ahead of the new municipal year. Whilst the final revised Constitution is not yet
complete, we are confident that this is being treated as a priority and would encourage that
once this has been finalised, that it is socialised across the organisation to ensure the changes
are understood by both Members and officers.

Due to resource and capacity challenges across the system of internal controls, risk
management remains underdeveloped across the organisation. A refreshed Corporate Risk
Register has been produced, and risk implications have been given greater visibility in reports
but the Council’s approach to risk management needs to be embedded, with risks properly
owned and managed by risk owners. It is also vital that there is alignment across risk registers
at corporate, directorate and service levels. This is an area that the Council should continue
to give urgent attention to.

While the Council has a 3 - year internal audit plan, internal audit still remains an area of
concern due to the resource levels and capacity of this vital area of work. The audit function
does not yet meet the Public Sector Internal Audit Standards (PSIAS) or demonstrated
readiness for the transition to the new Global Internal Audit Standards (GIAS) effective 1 April
2025. A report to the Audit Committee in March 2024, noted that “due to an insufficient number
of audits being completed in 2024/25, a Head of Internal Audit Opinion will not be issued **”.**
While internal audit can only offer reasonable assurance, not a 100% guarantee, the presence
of that reasonable assurance is rightly valued and a limitation of scope which has not been
appropriately addressed during the year is an issue not only for the Head of Internal Audit but
also for the leadership team and the Audit Committee who normally rely on that opinion. This
weakness indicates the likelihood that there are other areas of non-conformance and a Quality
Assurance and Improvement Programme, including an external quality assessment of the
Internal Audit service will be crucial.

Solid Overview and Scrutiny processes are now in place but there remains some political
immaturity that limits the effectiveness of the function. The Council should be encouraged to
offer training and for Members to take up the offer. It is also important that the Council reflects
on any lessons learned from the first year of these new arrangements and responds
accordingly to make further improvements.

The Council has taken seriously its responsibilities with regards to being the Accountable Body
for the Freeport. Outstanding issues surrounding the governance have largely been resolved
however Commissioners will not be satisfied that the Direction has been met until all the
necessary legal and governance arrangements are approved and finalised.

Culture


The BVI report outlined that poor leadership culture had contributed to the failings at Thurrock
Council. With the changes in some senior personnel and through the recruitment of new senior
leaders, there has been a marked improvement in terms of transparency and engagement.
Leaders interact more regularly with staff through a variety of staff engagement channels and
relationships between many senior politicians and staff are much improved. The previously
inward-facing council has recognised the ‘culture of insularity’ referenced in the BVI report and
has taken forward activity to address this issue and engage with partners and residents.

However, there are many facets of a positive organisational culture, and this is an area of work
that still seems underdeveloped at Thurrock. Any successful organisation will systemically
demonstrate accountability, transparency and a willingness to learn from others. It will have
the mechanisms and processes in place that support both organisational and personal growth
combined with a culture of engagement and collaboration. Whilst there is some evidence of
these aspects of Thurrock’s organisational culture, it is not commonplace and often siloed.
The Council needs to become more explicit about the culture it seeks to institutionalise and
devise programmes and reenforcing strategies, so that it becomes more deeply embedded in
the way that the Council thinks and acts. It is vital this is also directly embedded into the
revised staff performance management process to ensure it reaches and filters through all
parts of the organisation.

While the Council’s values were outlined in the new Corporate Plan, this organisational culture
and ‘One Council’ approach also needs to be built into the Council’s new way of working
through its revised operating model. Deeply embedding a positive culture across the
organisation will help mitigate the risk of the recovery work being too dependent on a few
individuals and give it the best chance of building on its improvements moving forward.

The recent staff survey highlighted areas where staff would like to see further improvements
across the organisation, for example in how the council works across teams and directorates
in a more collaborative way. It is vital that this feedback is fully considered and addressed,
and that staff understand the action plans that will be developed and put in place as a result
of their views.

Service Delivery

Despite the financial and organisational challenges Thurrock has endured, many services
continue to perform well. This is exemplified by the recent Ofsted rating of “outstanding” in
Children’s Services and by the very positive review by the Planning Advisory Service (PAS)
which noted progress across all eleven recommendations outlined in their Planning Peer
Challenge report. Internally there have also been structural changes within the organisation to
support the organisation embracing a ‘One Council’ approach, with resources moving from
within services to central teams to enable a strong partnership way of working between the
corporate centre and service delivery.

However, there are still some services within the Council where further discovery work is
taking place, such as in housing and homelessness, and legacy projects referenced within the
BVI report that are progressing but yet to be delivered, such as Stanford-le-Hope station.
Pressure on all services to change and adapt continues, through a combination of sector wide
demand rises but also the specific financial challenges of Thurrock Council.

Whilst there has been some “in service” change work, such as the review of strategic
commissioning and the improvements to customer experience, the Council is not benefitting
from a more strategic approach to transformation. Advances in technology could significantly
help the Council improve service delivery, whilst reducing operating costs. Consideration to
this should be incorporated into the Council’s new operating model and all parts of the Council


should be considering ways in which digital technology and innovative approaches could help
them provide more effective, cost-efficient services to residents.

With future budget rounds, savings targets and the associated difficult budget decisions that
will be needed, services will not be able to meet these through incremental efficiencies or
minor change programmes.

Partnerships and community engagement

The Council has demonstrated that it is more confident in its dealings with external partners.
It has engaged well and robustly in its dealing with the Freeport and is an active contributor
within the Greater Essex system, particularly within the context of devolution and LGR. There
are also strategic conversations taking place with the private sector to masterplan an
investment strategy for different parts of the Borough.

The Council’s engagement with its wider community, however, remains slow. The Council
purports to pursue a localisation agenda but the thinking and the planning as to how it will
achieve this are underdeveloped. The Council has undertaken a pilot project in one area of
the Borough and the outcomes are due to be reported to Cabinet at the time of writing this
report. This is welcomed. However, as the Council sees a localisation agenda as part of how
it will rebuild trust with its communities and is a key element of its new operating model, a
much more robust response is required.

Continuous improvement

Whilst the Council continues to make good progress with its recovery, there is always the
danger that it could fall back if the learning from the changes it has made are not systemically
applied to the broader organisation. Prior to intervention, Thurrock became an insular
organisation and did not seek out best practice with a mindset of continuous improvement. To
mitigate the potential fragilities of its improvement, the Council should give consideration as
to how it applies and embeds learning. This should be an important component of its culture
change programme. The way in which the Council uses its corporate Performance
Management and Assurance Framework (PMAF) and its regular reporting to Members to
monitor outcomes, support decision making and demonstrate continuous improvement will
also be a key element of this.

Furthermore, Thurrock has much to share with other organisations given its recovery journey
and in doing so, it will naturally become more outward facing and collaborative.

Consideration should be given to its performance management approach for staff, so that
individual learning is a key component of its appraisal process.

Conclusions and recommendations for the future

It is pleasing to be able to report progress on the Council’s improvement journey and its
willingness to engage with Commissioners positively. The Council also demonstrates good
self-awareness in terms of the progress it has made. There is still much work that still needs
to be done before it can fully demonstrate that is performing to a Best Value standard and is
capable of sustaining ongoing continued improvement without external intervention and
support.

Since the intervention at Thurrock Council started in September 2022, the Council has been
on a journey of discovery and recovery. Significant improvements have been made to the way
in which the Council operates to address some of the failings outlined within the Best Value
inspection report, and the Council’s leadership has demonstrated its commitment to these


improvements, reflected in the rapid pace of change in certain areas such as governance and
improved financial management. It is vital that the progress made so far is recognised and
praised, but the Council cannot afford to be complacent and lose this momentum.

The next stage of Thurrock’s journey should be one of strategic transformation. This is the
area where we have not yet seen sufficient progress. The Council is aware of this and has
outlined its ambitions within its Corporate Plan (the existence of which is itself a significant
step forward). It is also a vital element of delivering its savings targets for future years.
However, the transformation plan to deliver and implement the Council’s new operating model
has not yet been defined to the satisfaction of Commissioners and needs to be delivered at
pace.

Despite progress, it is our view that that Council is not yet meeting its Best Value Duty, and
evidence of this can be seen across several of the Best Value themes. We have confidence
that the Council has the determination and commitment to achieve this, yet recovery remains
fragile. Resource capacity and capability constraints combined with some cultural inertia are
impacting its ability to deliver embedded and sustained change. We have concerns that in
certain areas there are underdeveloped action plans to address some of the issues.

It is our recommendation that the intervention should continue and is extended beyond
September but over the course of this extension there should be a phased approach to winding
down the intervention, particularly as the outcomes of the LGR invitation become clearer over
time. The current commissioner model has provided Thurrock Council with an opportunity to
drive forward improvements, under the security, stability, guidance and support of a Managing
Director Commissioner. While we recommend that the external oversight that commissioners
provide should continue, the Minister may want to consider this alongside the appropriate
timing to consider phasing away the MDC model. It is vital that this is done on an agreed,
realistic timeframe that ensures that the organisation has the time to recruit permanently to
the Chief Executive role, ensures a smooth transition of the organisational leadership and
aligns with the timetables for the Council’s other transformation programmes of devolution and
LGR. Although more work is to be done, to recognise the significant progress that the Council
has achieved since September 2022 we also recommend that the Directions should be
refreshed and updated to ensure they reflect the wider context, acknowledge the
improvements made by the Council to date and emphasise the areas and actions for the
Council to treat as a priority in order to demonstrate it is meeting its Best Value duty and
delivering quality services and value for money for local residents.

Appendix 1 - Assessment of progress against Directions
```
```
Directions 2, 3 and 5-9 relate to the processes and running of the intervention. These have not been assessed individually here as they are
ongoing elements of the intervention. Commissioners continue to receive the support and information that they require from the Council and as
expressed in previous reports, the Council continues to engage positively with Commissioners and the intervention process. This has been the
case throughout all phases of the intervention and where there have been changes to the model of intervention in place.
```
Directions Status Assessment

1. Prepare and agree an Improvement and
    Recovery Plan to the satisfaction of the
    Commissioners, within 6 months, with
    resource allocated accordingly. This
    should include and draw upon the
    existing Improvement Plan produced in
    December 2022, per the Directions
    issued to the Authority on 2 September
    2022.

```
The plan is to set out measures to be
undertaken, together with milestones and
delivery targets against which to measure
performance, in order to deliver rapid and
sustainable improvements in
governance, leadership and culture in the
Authority, in the Authority’s exercise of its
overview and scrutiny functions and in its
performance of services, thereby
securing compliance with the Best Value
Duty.
```
```
The Improvement and Recovery Plan
should include at a minimum:
```
```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
Following the intervention starting in September 2022, the Council produced an initial
Improvement and Recovery Plan (IRP) in December 2022 and an enhanced IRP in
October 2023 following the expansion of the intervention in March 2023.
```
```
The Council has established and implemented a new quarterly cycle of reporting on their
enhanced IRP, which sits alongside their quarterly reporting on the Council’s performance.
These IRP reports provide an assessment on the progress made on the delivery of agreed
improvement outcomes and success criteria. These reports are routinely discussed with
Commissioners through Commissioner chaired Recovery Boards, and they are also taken
through the Council’s wider Governance process, including through the relevant Overview
and Scrutiny Committee, through Cabinet and through to Full Council for discussion each
quarter.
```
```
The Council has further ambitions to combine the reporting on their IRP into their wider
corporate performance reporting in future years. We welcome these plans which will
demonstrate that their improvement activity is no longer a separate workstream but
embedded into their wider organisational performance and continuous improvement.
However, this Direction cannot yet be considered as achieved in full since not all of the
subclauses from 1a - 1 i have been met at this stage.
```

1a. An action plan to achieve financial
sustainability and to close any short and
long-term budget gaps identified by the
Authority across the period of its MTFS
including a robust multi-year savings
plan.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
The Council’s financial position remains challenging and as we have noted in our previous
reports, the Council remains unable to balance its budget, or achieve financial
sustainability, without significant Government support.
```
```
Despite this, the Council has strengthened and further developed the financial models that
underpin the key financial strategies MTFS, CD, TMS, and programmes such as Asset
Disposals and Divestment pipelines, providing greater clarity on risk exposure and
opportunities, with assumptions carefully considered and regularly reviewed. Robust
internal governance process is in place for expenditure controls, tracking and reporting
savings progress against targets and identifying alternatives as may be required. Good
track record of budget and savings delivery.
```
```
The above provides a solid framework for medium-term financial planning.
The 20 2 5/26 budget was balanced with £72m EFS (£64m debt servicing costs and £8m
annual operational deficit) and the medium term financial outlook illustrated a residual gap
/ ambitious savings target of £41m to be bridged over the period of the plan. Savings of
this scale will not be fully addressed by tactical departmental savings.
```
```
The Council is due to commence the rolling refresh of its medium-term financial strategies,
which will need to reconcile the ambitions set out in the Corporate Plan, operating model
and full elimination of the forecasted operational deficits (£41m). Given the scale of the
financial challenge, the Council will need to accelerate and resource its transformation
programme, adopting a ‘One Council’ approach with collaboration between different
departments, services, and partner organisations to deliver a fundamental rethinking of
how services are provided and costs sustainably reduced.
```
```
The ring-fenced accounts HRA / DSG remain an integral part of this process and should
not be overlooked.
```
```
Sensitivity / stress testing will be required to assess the Council’s resilience to variations,
flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and facilitate informed future decision-
making.
```

```
Work will continue with government to explore further options to support the Council
towards long-term sustainability.
```
1b. An action plan to ensure the Authority’s
capital, investment and treasury
management strategies are sustainable
and affordable.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
Since the intervention started, there has been a substantial volume of work done to review
and refresh the Council’s financial strategies and to ensure compliance with accounting
practice and ensuring that these revised strategies triangulate together. Major
improvements have been made in this area ahead of setting the 2025/26 Budget and to
support ongoing discussions with MHCLG.
Further consideration will be required in developing a longer-term capital strategy that
guides the overall approach to sustainable and affordable capital investment across all
funds, including resource allocation, priorities, and the overall vision for how capital
projects will contribute to the Council’s goals.
```
1c. (^) A strict debt reduction plan, and an
updated minimum revenue provision
(MRP) policy in line with all relevant rules
and guidelines.
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
The Council has developed a plan which seeks to optimise the levers in its control to
reduce the overarching debt, whilst recognising that to achieve long term sustainability will
require government support.
The associated debt models are kept under close review and a programme of divestments
and asset disposals are ongoing. We urge the Council to continue to deliver on its plan,
demonstrating its commitment to tackling this issue through the various levers within their
control.
The Council has updated its Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) policy in compliance with
updated guidance from MHCLG and incorporates retrospective application of MRP
charges for past investments. The revised policy was approved as part of the 2024/
Budget.
At the start of each financial year the Council’s policy on making MRP in respect of that
financial year is submitted to full Council for approval (see 2025/26 Budget).
Commissioners have asked the Council to publish further detail on the MRP rules as per
the new guidance and to report this back to the next quarterly Cabinet.


```
MRP will be subject to review by the Council’s external Auditors Ernst & Young (EY).
```
1d. To ensure compliance with all relevant
rules and guidelines relating to the
financial management of the Authority.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
The Council, under the leadership of the current Chief Finance Officer, has taken steps to
strengthen its financial management and has started a quarterly cycle of sharing budget
monitoring reports with the Cabinet. This has enabled services and directorates across the
organisation to have a greater understanding of their budgets and savings targets and
effectively track and monitor their spending and respond accordingly. The Chief Finance
Officer’s S25 statement alongside the 2025/26 budget noted that “every effort has been
made to ensure the technical assumptions underpinning the budget are robust and
compliant with accounting practice. However further reviews are planned in line with the
Financial Management Code.”
The Council must ensure that the financial management, reporting and regulation
arrangements in place, to govern the strategic and operational management of its budgets,
investments, funding, assets and companies, are in accordance with CIPFA’s Financial
Management Code. They are planning on doing this self-assessment early in the 2025/
financial year.
```
```
The outcome of the assessment will facilitate the refresh of the finance improvement plan,
including the resources required to deliver the improvements.
```
1e. (^) A suitable scheme of delegations for
financial decision-making.
Not achieved (^) The Council are aware that this remains a priority and in their S25 statement alongside the
2025/26 Budget, the Chief Finance Officer included “finalising fit for purpose financial
regulations based upon the review by CIPFA” as one of the areas of focus for the Council
over the next period.
The draft update of the financial regulations and scheme of delegation based on the CIPFA
review of financial decision making is underway. We urge the Council to maintain the pace
in delivery of these objectives, alongside the work it is doing to review and refresh its
Constitution. Once established, these should be socialised and cascaded across the
organisation, so they are embedded in the Council’s ways of working and understood by
both officers and Members.


1f. An action plan to reconfigure the
Authority’s services commensurate with
the Authority’s available financial
resources.

```
Not achieved The Council is aware that they need to operate differently from how they have worked in
the past and there is a commitment to undertake a new approach and deliver differently
for the benefit of their residents. This ambition is articulated in their recently published
Corporate Plan. However, as outlined above, the work to outline how the Council’s
proposed operating model will be implemented into a single integrated plan is still at a very
early stage and is underdeveloped. Other significant transformation programmes, such as
devolution and LGR, must not reduce focus or capacity on the important work the Council
must do to transform how it operates. Commissioners remain focused on this as a priority
and have asked for a roadmap outlining how this transformation plan will be delivered as
it is crucial that this now progresses at pace. There is also more work to do to ensure buy
in and support for the corporate transformation programme.
```
1g. A plan to ensure that the Authority has
personnel with sufficient skills,
capabilities and capacity to deliver the
Improvement and Recovery Plan, within
a robust officer structure.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
The Council has recruited to a new organisational leadership structure, which has brought
about the necessary leadership capacity and culture to drive the increased pace and
breadth of improvement. Further structural changes have been taking place within the
organisation through a more phased approach, as part of the Council’s plans to embed a
‘One Council’ approach to performance and policy through strengthening and rebuilding
the skills, capacity and capability within the Council’s corporate centre and enabling a
strong partnership way of working between the corporate centre and service delivery.
```
```
On skills and capability, training and development opportunities are being offered to both
Members and officers, both internally and via external partners, to ensure that Members
and officers understand what is required of them in their roles and to provide them with a
deeper understanding of what is expected within a good organisation, helping to
demonstrate that the Council has a culture that embraces learning, challenge and
continuous improvement.
```
```
This Direction has not yet been met given the risks around the number of agency, interim
or non-permanent staff and vacancies in key positions across the Council. This is true at
the most senior levels, but also across areas where further improvement activity remains
a priority including finance, procurement, risk and internal audit.
```

1h. An action plan to strengthen the
Authority’s governance function, to
secure improvements in transparency
and formal decision making. This should
include measures to improve the
Authority’s scrutiny function, including the
taking and recording of formal decisions.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
The Council has an action plan in place to make the necessary improvements to their
governance practices and to improve the quality of decision-making. Members and officers
have engaged positively with the new measures that have been introduced, including a
strengthened forward look and improved processes for report writing through a new online
system.
Work to review and refresh the Constitution was due to be completed ahead of the new
municipal year. Although we are confident that this work is progressing and that positive
discussions have taken place with Members and officers to engage them in the outcome
of this work, we await a final revised Constitution that is fit for purpose as well as fully
supported and deeply understood by all parts the Council.
```
```
The Overview and Scrutiny (O&S) arrangements have been refreshed, streamlined and
strengthened, and culturally there has been a shift whereby O&S is now valued as an
essential component of the decision-making process. This is especially evidenced through
the joint Scrutiny meeting on the Council’s Budget proposals. The Council has taken the
opportunity to undertake an external review of these arrangements, through the Centre for
Governance and Scrutiny, and as a result, further improvements are likely to be made to
respond to the lessons learned from the first year of trialling this new approach. As the
new Municipal year begins, we encourage the new O&S Chairs and Committee Members
to continue to build on the success of this first year and embed the lessons for future years.
```
```
The Council’s commitment to promoting transparency has also been demonstrated by its
increased and improved corporate performance reporting, financial reporting and the
proposed changes to the Constitution.
```
```
As we note later on, the system of internal controls still remains a priority and both risk
management and internal audit are areas where we want to see continued focus in the
coming months.
```
1i. Arrangements to secure the proper
resourcing and functioning of the system

```
Not achieved While the report outlines the progress made to embed risk management and to make
improvements to the internal audit processes across the Council, recruitment challenges
remain in these areas, affecting the capacity for the Council to balance delivery of the
required improvement work with its business as usual activity. This is demonstrated for
```

```
of internal controls, including risk
management and internal audit.
```
```
example, by a report that went to the Audit Committee in March 2024, which noted that
“due to an insufficient number of audits being completed in 2024/25, a Head of Internal
Audit Opinion will not be issued”. Commissioners are concerned that this team has had
significant turnover of staff and still relies on interim capacity. A Quality Assurance and
Improvement Programme evaluation, including an external quality assessment of the
Internal Audit service will be crucial.
```
```
We have significant concerns around the capacity, capability and resource levels across
the system of internal controls at present. As the Council looks towards exiting intervention,
it will need to demonstrate and provide assurance to Commissioners that its system of
internal controls is robust and challenging, properly resourced, and sufficiently understood
and valued by the leadership and wider organisation to ensure any risks and issues are
mitigated or dealt with appropriately.
```
4. To take steps to ensure that the role of
    Accountable Body to the Thames
    Freeport is exercised to the satisfaction of
    the Commissioners. This should be
    reflected in the Authority’s Improvement
    and Recovery Plan.

```
Ongoing but not
yet achieved
```
```
Commissioners welcome the progress made by the Council working with its partners to
formalise the necessary governance agreements for the Thames Freeport although these
are still awaiting final approval. The Council has also taken steps internally to deliver its
role e.g. through improving decision making in relation to decisions on funding of the
Freeport and the Council is also reporting on key milestones in relation to “fulfil[ing] the
leadership and governance role of Freeport Accountable Body” in its quarterly Corporate
Performance reporting.
```
```
The Council has made progress in this area which has enabled the dialogue with partners
to move from practical issues into a more strategic space around the ambitions and aims
of the Freeport for the Council, partners, residents, businesses and the local area, however
Commissioners will not be satisfied that this Direction has been met until all the necessary
legal and governance arrangements are approved and finalised.
```
