 HACC Policy - Human Advocacy Compliance Cycle

Tags: #HACC #NoGhosting #Consumer-Customer #OpenSense #Obinexus

We are developing a recruitment and advocacy policy under the OpenSense framework that prioritizes individuals who have been unfairly displaced or rendered redundant by companies lacking proper offboarding practices.

Our goal is to identify and engage individuals who are passionate, experienced, and motivated by their own experiences of being unjustly let go. These individuals will be invited to become part of the OpenSense team, where they can contribute meaningfully and help shape a more humane and ethical business environment.

This recruitment approach is rooted in advocacy. We believe that those who have experienced mistreatment in the workplace are often the most driven to support change and innovation. By bringing them into OpenSense, we create a cycle of advocacy: they help others, spread awareness, and contribute to the larger mission of transforming how organizations handle employment transitions.

This policy will be formalized and embedded in our recruitment strategy. It includes identifying potential candidates through outreach programs, partnerships with worker support organizations, and platforms where displaced workers seek new opportunities. Candidates will be supported through a transparent onboarding process, and their experiences will inform continuous improvement of our practices.

In essence, this is not just recruitment. It's systemic repair through opportunity.

Legal Framework for Redundancy:
In the UK, if an employee's role becomes redundant, the employer must follow a fair process, including consultation and providing a notice period. Statutory notice periods include:

At least one week's notice if employed between one month and two years.

One week's notice for each year if employed between two and twelve years.

Twelve weeks' notice if employed for twelve years or more.

Employees with at least two years of continuous service are entitled to statutory redundancy pay. This is based on age, length of service, and weekly earnings, up to a capped amount.

Employers must adhere to these requirements to ensure fair treatment during redundancy and avoid illegal or unethical practices.

We aim to ensure any innovation or role evolution adheres to this framework. Whether we prove non-redundancy in one year or over several, the principle remains: within ten years, the legitimacy of the role must be established. Implementation can vary, but the ethical commitment must remain consistent.

Trending Corporate Behavior:
It is increasingly common in corporate environments to treat innovation as justification for immediate job displacement. A new feature, service, or tool emerges, and rather than adapting roles to integrate these changes, employees are told they are no longer needed. This reactive trend-"innovate and fire"-is not only ethically questionable but also legally precarious in many jurisdictions.

OpenSense rejects this model. We believe innovation should be an additive process, not a subtractive one. Displaced employees must be given due process, support, and pathways to transition-within or beyond the organization. We commit to resisting the trend of treating human resources as expendable in the face of technological progress.

Case Study: Elon Musk and Mass Layoffs
One of the most publicized examples of reactive corporate downsizing occurred under Elon Musk's leadership at Twitter. Following his acquisition of the company, Musk reduced Twitter's workforce by nearly 80%. The scale and speed of these layoffs led to widespread criticism and concern over employee treatment, with reports of abrupt terminations and minimal support provided.

This same approach has surfaced at Tesla and other Musk-led ventures, where economic shifts or new strategic directions have prompted layoffs without clear redundancy procedures or transition plans. While innovation remains central to these organizations, the cost has often been employee morale, trust, and long-term sustainability.

This case illustrates the consequences of prioritizing efficiency and disruption over ethical responsibility. It underscores why frameworks like OpenSense are essential-not just for compliance, but for building resilient, human-centered organizations.

Case Study: Widespread Ghosting in the Tech Industry
Ghosting-the practice of ending communication without notice or explanation-has become disturbingly common across the tech sector. Numerous companies, including Meta, Funko, Medtronic, CommScope, and others, have been flagged by applicants and collaborators for initiating conversations or interviews and then never following up, even after polite follow-up messages. This is documented in online forums and professional review platforms.

While some organizations may cite reasons such as lack of fit or shifting priorities, the consistent absence of closure reveals a structural disregard for human dignity. Ghosting not only undermines the emotional and professional wellbeing of individuals but also contributes to a broader culture of disposability.

OpenSense stands in stark contrast to this practice. We advocate for structured communication policies, including mandatory follow-up and transparent status updates for all professional engagements. Our recruitment and partnership protocols emphasize dignity, closure, and reciprocal respect. Ethical treatment of people isn't a bonus-it's the baseline.

Consumer-Customer Policy Integration:

Product Delivery Guarantee: Minimum viable product must be provided at each milestone completion.

Gamification Compliance: Engagement systems must deliver tangible value, not exploit user behavior.

Systematic Documentation: All interactions must be documented and supported by a legal framework.

Dignity Preservation: No rushed partnerships. We walk away from exploitative arrangements.

Milestone Validation Framework:

Technical Specification for Consumer Protection:
Each milestone requires:

Functional Deliverable: Working software/research output with documentation

Consumer Validation Period: 30-day testing window with full support

Communication Log: Weekly status updates with technical progress metrics

Quality Assurance: Independent third-party validation where applicable

Legal Framework: Contracts protect both innovation timeline and consumer rights

Success Metric: Consumer/customer receives promised product functionality before next milestone funding release.
