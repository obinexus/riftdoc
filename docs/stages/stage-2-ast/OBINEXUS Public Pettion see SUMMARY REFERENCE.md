Reform the UK’s Health and Social Care System

Change.org Petition

Initiative by: OBINexus (Nnamdi Michael Okpala)
Launched: 2024
Core Themes: Integration • Accountability • Fairness • Healing

Synopsis

The petition anchors the civil-collapse documentation within a national reform context. It voices the lived consequences of structural neglect — from housing denial and forced medication to intergenerational trauma — while proposing a framework for systematic accountability through open, verifiable architecture.

OBINexus extends the petition’s call into code and protocol: turning public testimony into legal, computational, and cultural infrastructure.

Integration Path

Public Testimony → Legal Encoding
Petitions serve as authenticated social proof, feeding the case archive (textbook-entries repo).

Legal Encoding → System Logic
Policy failures are translated into data schemas (e.g., polycall, auraSeal, gate.in).

System Logic → Reform Protocols
Deployed as OBINexus reform templates for councils, universities, and survivor networks.

Meta-Message

“When systems fail, we build our own — not to replace institutions, but to remind them what they were meant to be.”
