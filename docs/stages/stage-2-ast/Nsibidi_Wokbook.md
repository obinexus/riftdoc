寍肝肝字寎奥械 | The Reformed Nsibidi Script

This is the reformed nsibidi script for use with the Igbo language. Each character (symbol)
represents an Igbo word, usually monosyllabic verbs that make up much of the Igbo language. Each
character has a reading. For example, 畝 is ‘and’ (nà / nà). By pairing the symbols together you
create a sentence. Akagu, the nsibidi derived alphabet, is used to support the nsibidi, like in this
case where the readings of each character are given in green. Akagu is an nsibidi derived short
hand that’s used for learning, and the akagu elu, or capitalised akagu form, is for non-Igbo words
that wouldn’t have nsibidi characters such as non-Igbo names.

The main use of nsibidi is to take away the ambiguities from the vast amount of homophones
in the Igbo language. Fully phonetic writing systems, such as Latin and other alphabets, do not
disambiguate words very well, even with diacritics (tone marks like ́ in á). In the case of tone
marks, there are still Igbo words with the same tone marks such as nà(nà)(and) nà(nà)(a
conjunction, like ‘that’ in English), and nà(nà)(in), nsibidi represents these as 畝,朽,and 営.
The ambiguity of Igbo words doesn’t affect speech very much because of context, and writing small
sentences is not too much of a problem, but in large documents, there is an extra effort to decipher
words. And then there are the different Igbo dialects. Because each nsibidi symbol represents an
Igbo word, readings of one character can be done in multiple dialects. For example 畝, ’and’ can be
read as nà or là. The system was partly born out of the intention to create new Igbo words and to
keep words from fading, especially due to ambiguities.

There are around 2500 characters in this system. While this may sound like a lot, and there would
be considerable memorisation needed, most of the symbols are formed from a handful of symbols
which form as the base or radicals of each character. Within each symbol, there is a kind of story
using ideographs and pictograms that are mostly from the original nsibidi in terms of aesthetic and
function.

This is a proposed script. The value in learning it, in addition to the aforementioned functionalities,
is to keep a very old indigenous communication system alive in a reformed way that can be used to
write not just Igbo, but the languages of the area that historically used nsibidi, today. This way, this
would be a continuation and also a conscious effort to preserve something that has been passed
down for centuries, if not millennia.

妻畝㥻依寎及貝怠延慨 | Simple Introductory Characters and Sentences
```
```
These are simple nsibidi characters which will be used to form simple Igbo sentences here. The
method here is to memorise the readings of each symbol (the largest ones in the top left of each
section) which are in akagu in green and in Latin characters under that.
```
```
Each symbol can be seen to represent a sort of story, like in the ideographic use of the original
nsibidi symbols these characters are derived from. To the right of each section, the story of
the making up of the character is revealed. Each character is made from a radical which aids in
memorising each character. The radicals are only there to help, they don’t need to be memorised,
only the general idea. A sentence utilising the characters you are about to learn will follow which
serves as an example of nsibidi writing for Igbo. It would be good to copy these characters out.

㥻依寎穴棺妻顎 | Example Sentence From the Previous Characters

Now that you’ve seen some simple nsibidi characters (symbols), these Igbo sentences written in
nsibidi should be readable.

First, a simple word. The reading of each character is given in akagu in green, the meaning in
English underneath:

# 子女

```
nwä ąnyį
```
```
woman
```
You should have been able to read the characters above as woman in Igbo, nwaanyi, or any
dialectal variation of these two words that form the word for woman in Igbo. Now that you may
have gotten the idea of how words are formed and then read in nsibidi, the following are some
sentences, this time without the English translation.

# 子女火衛子男

```
nwä ąnyį gá kwú nwä óké
```
In case the meanings of the two characters in the middle are not clear, this means to go towards.

# 火衛

```
gá kwú
```
```
go towards
```
The 衛 is a suffix or verb that means going towards.

# .


## 7

Some more examples. This time without any akagu or English translations, and in the smaller size
that would be typical in documents. These symbols have all been previously explained above. You
can go back for reference.

子男禾扱.
鋭依火.
人禾依.
子男禾依.

This is the way to write Igbo in the reformed nsibidi, with some other notable feature here and
there. Everything is written in this way, sentences, names, notes, etc., with akagu to help.
