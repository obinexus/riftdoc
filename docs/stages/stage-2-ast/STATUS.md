I see the immediate issue is with the build process failing due to missing dependencies. Let's address this first, then we can discuss the organization and planning for the Nexus components.

## Dependency Issues

The error shows we're missing `rollup-plugin-typescript2`, which is imported in the rollup config. We need to install the necessary dependencies for the build process:

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup rollup-plugin-typescript2 @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs @rollup/plugin-terser rollup-plugin-dts @rollup/plugin-alias
```

## Project Organization Analysis

Based on the directory structure and files provided, I can see the project has been organized with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core (src/core)**: Contains all the fundamental search engine functionality
2. **CLI (src/cli)**: Provides a command-line interface to the core functionality

The current organization follows good practices with:
- Separation of algorithms, storage, and document processing
- Proper typing throughout the codebase
- Utility functions for performance monitoring, validation, etc.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix build configuration**:
   - Install missing dependencies
   - Ensure paths in rollup.config.js match the actual project structure

2. **Storage Component Integration**:
   - Review the existing storage adapters (`IndexedDBAdapter`, `InMemoryAdapter`)
   - Ensure they implement the `StorageAdapter` interface consistently

3. **Validate module imports**:
   - Confirm the path aliases in tsconfig.json match the import statements
   - Test the core functionality with simple unit tests before full integration

## Proposed Plan for nexus-document

For the nexus-document component (detailed HTML reports), I recommend implementing this as a separate module that consumes the search engine's results. This should:

1. Define a clear document schema that can represent:
   - Search index structure
   - Document corpus statistics
   - Query performance metrics

2. Implement a report generator with:
   - Templating system for HTML output
   - Export capabilities (HTML, PDF)
   - Visualization components for metrics and index structure

3. Integration points with the core engine:
   - Telemetry hooks for performance data
   - Index structure exporters
   - Search result formatters

This approach will maintain separation of concerns while providing a comprehensive reporting tool that leverages the core functionality.

Let me know if you'd like to focus on any specific aspect of this plan first, or if you have questions about the implementation details.
