### **Ground 2: Breach of Statutory Housing Duties**

1. **Mental Capacity Weaponization**
   - Claiming lack of capacity despite bachelor's degree
   - Using autism diagnosis to deny housing rights
   - Ignoring presumption of capacity (s.1 MCA 2005)

2. **Failure to Make Reasonable Adjustments**
   - No autism-friendly communication methods
   - Hostile environment in supported accommodation
   - No sensory accommodations provided

**Legal Framework**:
- Equality Act 2010, s.15 (discrimination arising from disability)
- Equality Act 2010, s.20 (reasonable adjustments duty)
- UN CRPD Article 19 (independent living rights)

### **Ground 4: Human Rights Violations**

## **PART C: URGENCY FACTORS**

### **Cambridge Master's Program - October 2025**

**Critical Timeline**:
- Application accepted: Cambridge University, Mechanical Engineering
- Accommodation requirement: Independent housing near Cambridge
- Current barrier: Council refusing housing transfer
- Financial impact: Loss of educational opportunity worth £500,000+ lifetime earnings

**Kent Trust Certificate Issue**:
- Independent living certificate earned at Trust Foundation (Kent)
- Council refusing to recognize qualification
- Creating artificial capacity concerns

### **Section 114 Recovery Context**

The Greater Essex Mayoral Combined County Authority (consultation closing April 13, 2025) offers opportunity for systemic reform. Delay prejudices both individual remedy and regional transformation.
