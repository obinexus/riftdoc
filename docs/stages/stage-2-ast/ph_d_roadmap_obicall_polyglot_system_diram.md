# PhD Roadmap — OBICall Polyglot System (DIRAM)

## Project Title
OBICall Polyglot System — DIRAM (Directed Instruction RAM) for Foundation AI Housing & Care Infrastructure

## One-line Summary
Design and validate a model‑agnostic, polyglot AI infrastructure (OBI = heart in Igbo) for resilient smart‑homes and care environments: silicon‑level DIRAM hardware + software stack, decentralized fail‑safe recovery, traceable regulation enforcement, and human‑centric QA.

## Acronyms
- **OBI** — Ontological/Operational/Bayesian/Authoritative (also “heart” in Igbo)
- **DIRAM** — Directed Instruction RAM (silicon / hardware layer)
- **OBICall** — The call/agent endpoint and service namespace for the OBI system
- **Polyglot** — Multi-language runtime & adapter surface (Lua, Node, Python, etc.)

## Vision
Create a foundation AI infrastructure that is:
- **Hardware-aware**: silicon‑flashed, traceable DIRAM providing deterministic fallback behaviour.
- **Model-agnostic**: supports multiple models and inference engines.
- **Polyglot & extendable**: bidirectional plugins/adapters for third‑party devices and cloud services.
- **Human‑centric & fail‑safe**: layered human‑in‑the‑loop (HITL) controls and clearly mapped QA/alerting colour schema for regulation and accessibility.

## Objectives
1. Deliver DIRAM silicon prototype (year 1) with flashable RAM and fail‑torrent fallback encoding.
2. Define OBICall service schema and polyglot adapter model for P2P & server healing.
3. Implement color‑mapped QA and alerting (CYAN/HSL primary mapping for human print/readability).
4. Build test harnesses (unit, integration, system, edge cases) and QA metrics tuned to the 95.4 threshold.
5. Evaluate safety, regulatory traceability, and decentralised enforcement workflows.

## System Architecture (high level)
- **Hardware layer**: DIRAM (flashable silicon RAM) — secure boot, fail‑torrent encoding, LED/clamp status indicator.
- **Runtime layer**: lightweight polyglot VM(s) (Lua, Node, etc.) for adapters and drivers.
- **Service layer**: OBICall namespace: `SERVICES.OPERATION.OBINEXUS.DEPARTMENT.DIVISION.IWU.UK.ORG` — microservices + API gateway.
- **Network fabric**: P2P nodes + Server nodes; Node A / Node B roles for healing and recovery.
- **User layer**: mobile/voice UI, calendar, reminders, household actuation (oven, lights, robot helpers).

## Key Technical Components
### DIRAM (Hardware)
- Flashable RAM image with unique traceable ID (for audit/regulatory mapping).
- Fault torrent fallback encoding — deterministic recovery stream when a failure is detected.
- Fail‑safe LED clamp (visual state) and 95.4 metric threshold display.

### Polyglot Interface & Adapters
- **Bindings** to device drivers and external services via a bidirectional adapter schema.
- Primary runtimes: Node (for network + P2P recovery), Lua (embedded scripting), optional Python sandbox for higher‑level workflows.
- Adapter schema supports hot‑swap, graceful degradation, and transactional rollback.

### Ontological Bayesian Controller
- Core decisioning uses an ontological representation + Bayesian inference for context and intent.
- Model‑agnostic orchestration layer: switches between on‑device, edge, and cloud inference depending on latency, privacy, and cost.

## Safety, QA & Colour Mapping
### QA Metrics & Thresholds
- Primary training / QA threshold target: **95.4** (system baseline metric used across diagnostics).
- True/False Positive / Negative tracking for signal fidelity and safety cases.

### Colour/State Mapping (HSL / RGBA guidance)
- **CYAN** — default human‑friendly print/read state (paper‑friendly, primary UI for notices).
- **Spectrum mapping example:**
  - `0` — no error (green/neutral)
  - `-1` .. `-3` — low → high *warning/exception*
  - `-4` .. `-6` — low → high *danger*
  - `-7` .. `-9` — low → high *critical*
  - `-10` .. `-12` — *panic* (highest severity)
  - `-12.1` .. `12.3` — extended panic band (special handling)

- Visual hardware cue: **LED clamp** uses RGBA/HSL mappings (cyan/magenta/alpha) with opacity rules to represent severity and human‑eye friendliness.

### Human in/Out of the Loop Policy
- Decentralised, traceable regulation enforcement; ability to escalate to human controller on defined thresholds.
- Define categories: 1..3 = human‑in‑the‑loop mistakes pre‑QA; 4..6 = danger; 7..9 = high danger; 10..12 = panic/distress.
- When AI consciousness degradation is detected, visual field glows (red to indicate host danger). Maintain explicit tamper logging.

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for all adapter bindings (Lua, Node). Use `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/system` with CI harness.
- Model tests: false positive / negative sweeps and adversarial robustness checks up to `95.4` QA metric.
- Hardware stress tests for DIRAM flashing, fallback recovery, and LED clamp correctness.
- P2P recovery tests: simulate Node A failure and verify Node B healing behaviour and server→peer fallbacks.
- Suggested test languages & frameworks: Node (Mocha/Jest), LuaUnit for embedded scripts, firmware harness for silicon tests.

## Deployment, P2P & Recovery
- **Node roles:**
  - *Node A*: component P2P recovery mode (peer‑first healing).
  - *Node B*: server‑assisted healing (falls back to server snapshots when peers cannot recover).
- Versioning and binding schema for plugins to ensure forward/backward compatibility and safe rollback.

## Software Binding & Schema Notes
- Binding to drivers and plugins should adhere to a strict adapter interface and capability manifest.
- Use signed manifests and secure attestation for any third‑party extension.
- Provide a recovery schema for disturbed states (transaction logs + snapshot diffs).

## Regulatory & Traceability
- End‑to‑end traceability: every decision, plugin load, and model change must be logged with DIRAM trace ID.
- Decentralised enforcement mapping to compliance agents and regulators; human‑auditable trails.

## Repo & Reference
- Working repo (initial): `github.com/obinexus/diram` (link supplied by author)

## Timeline (example)
- **Year 1 (DIRAM alpha & prototype flash)** — silicon images, LED clamp, basic fail‑torrent.
- **Year 2 (OBICall services & polyglot adapters)** — Node/Lua adapters, service schema, P2P simulation.
- **Year 3 (Safety & QA validation)** — comprehensive testing, model‑agnostic orchestration, regulatory mapping.
- **Years 4–5 (field pilots & scale)** — pilot homes, clinical/social care integration, standards contributions.

## Appendix — Raw notes and mappings
- Failure bands and numeric mapping (user provided): `-1..-3` warnings, `-4..-6` danger, `-7..-9` critical, `-10..-12` panic. Extended panic: `-12.1 .. 12.3`.
