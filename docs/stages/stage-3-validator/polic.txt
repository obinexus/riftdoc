# PoliC: Security Framework for Sandboxed Environments

PoliC is a cutting-edge C security framework that protects virtualized and sandboxed environments by enforcing function-level security through smart branching statements. Every call to critical functions is automatically intercepted by our decorator-enforced policy mechanism, preventing unauthorized function execution.

## Features

- **VM Hooks Integration**: Direct integration with virtualization environments
- **Stack Protection**: Advanced mechanisms to prevent stack-based attacks
- **Policy Decorators**: Wrap any function with customizable security policies
- **Inline Policy Injection**: Embed security checks directly within critical functions
- **Configurable Actions**: Allow, block, or just log function calls based on context

## Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

```c
#include <polic/polic.h>

void my_function() {
    // Function implementation
}

int main() {
    // Initialize with sandbox mode and blocking policy
    polic_init(true, POLIC_BLOCK);

    // In the full implementation, you'd use:
    // void (*secured_func)() = POLIC_DECORATOR(my_function);
    // secured_func();
    
    return 0;
}
```
