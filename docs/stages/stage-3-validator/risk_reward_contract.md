## Part III: Entrapment Protection Matrix

### 3.1 The 8 Entrapment Algorithms (Detection & Mitigation)

| Algorithm | Detection Criteria | Automated Response | Compensation Trigger |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Improbability** | Success odds calculated <5% despite "qualification" | Flag milestone as potentially exploitative, require revision | If proven: £10,000 base + £1,000/day delayed |
| **Exhaustion** | Response delays >14 days, repeated non-resolution | Automatic ghosting violation, escalate to legal | £5,000 base + £500/day delayed |
| **Loopback** | Same actor contacted 3+ times, no escalation | Force escalation to HITL/governance | £3,000 base + £300/day delayed |
| **Silence** | Zero communication for 14+ days after documented inquiry | Automatic breach declaration, payment withheld | £5,000 base + £500/day silent |
| **Assertion** | Contradictory statements vs documented evidence | Constitutional Compliance Engine review, penalty assessed | £10,000 base + £1,000 per false assertion |
| **Contradiction** | Multiple services/teams providing conflicting info | Force coordination meeting within 48 hours | £5,000 base + £500/day unresolved |
| **Intimidability** | Threats, coercion, or power imbalance exploitation | Immediate actor suspension, legal review | £20,000 base + permanent exclusion |
| **Tripling** | 3+ algorithms active simultaneously | Civil collapse declaration, maximum penalties | £50,000 base + full project compensation |

### 3.2 Universal Pension Allocation (UPA)
When entrapment algorithms are verified by the Constitutional Compliance Engine:

1. **Automatic Calculation:** Algorithm type + days delayed + severity multiplier
2. **Immediate Allocation:** Funds transferred to victim's UPA account within 7 days
3. **Perpetrator Liability:** 100% liability assigned to violating party
4. **Public Record:** Violation logged in permanent audit trail

- **DA** = Deadline Adherence (0-100)
- **QS** = Quality Standards (0-100)
- **HRR** = Human Rights Respect (0-100)
- **NGC** = No Ghosting Compliance (0-100)

### 5.2 Component Definitions

**Communication Transparency (25% weight):**

- Responded to inquiries within maximum timeframes
- Provided honest, complete information

    ↓                                              ↓
REJECTED                                  VERIFICATION_PENDING
                                                   ↓
                                         COMPLETED / REJECTED
                                                   ↓
                                          SUSPENDED (if violations)
                                                   ↓
