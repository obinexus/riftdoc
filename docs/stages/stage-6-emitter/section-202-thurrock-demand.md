## FORMAL NOTICE: TRANSFORMING HOUSING NEED INTO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

Under Housing Act 1996, Part VII, Section 202, I request review of your Section 184 decision and propose the **IWU Live-Work Constitutional Community** - a self-sustaining solution to Thurrock's housing crisis that generates economic value.

## 2. WHY THURROCK NEEDS THIS NOW

### Your Problems:
- **Â£700M** lost - need new revenue streams
