# Definitions & Setup 

* Let ( \mathbb{B}={0,1} ). States live in a finite state space ( \Sigma ).
* Let ( \mathcal{T} ) be the set of atomic transitions (operations) on ( \Sigma ). Example elements: (h_e\in H_e), (h_o\in H_o).
* A *transition application* is ( \tau: \Sigma \times I \to \Sigma ), where (I) is an *input token* (user click, API payload, external message).
* Let (F: \mathcal{T}^* \to \mathrm{End}(\Sigma)) be your functor that maps sequences of transitions (and their inputs) to state transformation functions (endomorphisms on (\Sigma)).
* Let PRNG be a deterministic pseudo-random generator ( \mathrm{PRNG} : \mathbb{Z}*m \to {S_n}*{n\ge0}) parameterized by a seed (s). Given seed (s), the sequence (S_0,S_1,\dots) is fully determined.
* Telemetry trace for an execution (E) is a tuple
  [
  \mathcal{R}_E = (g, s, , \mathcal{L}, , \Delta)
  ]
  where

  * (g) = GUID trace id,
  * (s) = cryptographic seed (e.g. SHA-256(user+time+nonce) truncated → integer),
  * (\mathcal{L} = [(t_1,i_1),(t_2,i_2),\dots,(t_k,i_k)]) = ordered event log (timestamps (t_j), inputs (i_j), binding/router id, environment tags),
  * (\Delta) = optional snapshot(s) of system memory / state at certain checkpoints.

# Goal

Prove: given (\mathcal{R}_E), the replay procedure deterministically reconstructs the state sequence ( \sigma_0 \xrightarrow{\tau_1} \sigma_1 \xrightarrow{\tau_2} \dots \xrightarrow{\tau_k} \sigma_k ) (where (\tau_j = F(\text{binding}, i_j, S_j)) possibly depends on PRNG value (S_j)).

## Lemma 1 — PRNG determinism

Given seed (s), the PRNG sequence (S_0,S_1,\dots) is deterministic.
*Reason:* PRNG is a deterministic recurrence (LCG, xorshift, or cryptographic stream) — same seed ⇒ same sequence. Use cryptographic seed mapping (s = \mathrm{Hash}(\text{GUID} | \text{time} | \text{nonce})).

## Lemma 2 — Functorial composition yields a monoid

Define the set (M = { F(w) \mid w\in\mathcal{T}^* }). Composition (\circ) on (M) is associative and identity is (F(\epsilon)=\mathrm{id}_\Sigma). Hence ((M,\circ)) is a monoid.
*Reason:* Composition of endomorphisms is associative; the empty sequence maps to identity. Functor (F) preserves concatenation: (F(w_1\cdot w_2)=F(w_1)\circ F(w_2)).

## Lemma 3 — Transition determinism given full inputs & PRNG

If for each step (j) the transition (\tau_j) is computed by a pure function of:

* prior state (\sigma_{j-1}),
* input (i_j) (captured in (\mathcal{L})),
* PRNG output (S_j) (from seed (s)),
* binding/router id + environment tags (in (\mathcal{L})),

then (\sigma_j) is uniquely determined by ((\sigma_{j-1}, i_j, S_j)).
*Reason:* pure function with those arguments is deterministic.

## Theorem — Deterministic Reproducibility (Sketch)

**Given** telemetry record (\mathcal{R}_E=(g,s,\mathcal{L},\Delta)) that captures (a) ordered inputs (\mathcal{L}) with binding/router/context tags, (b) cryptographic seed (s), and (c) any snapshots (\Delta) needed for non-recoverable state, **then** there exists a deterministic replay algorithm ( \mathrm{Replay}(\mathcal{R}_E) ) that reconstructs the same state sequence (\sigma_0,\dots,\sigma_k).

**Proof sketch:**

1. Initialize PRNG with (s) → deterministic (S_0,S_1,\dots). (Lemma 1)
2. Initialize system state to snapshot (\sigma_0) (from (\Delta)); if no snapshot, use canonical initial state.
3. For (j=1..k):

   * Fetch ((t_j,i_j)) from (\mathcal{L}).
   * Fetch (S_{j}) from PRNG sequence.
   * Identify binding/router (b_j) and environment tags from (\mathcal{L}).
   * Compute (\sigma_j = \tau_j(\sigma_{j-1}, i_j; S_j, b_j)), where (\tau_j) is the pure function encoded by (F) for that binding.
   * Because (\tau_j) is pure and its inputs are fully determined by (\mathcal{R}_E), (\sigma_j) is uniquely determined (Lemma 3).
4. Repeat to produce entire replay trace. Because PRNG, inputs, and binding contexts are identical to original run, the produced path equals original path.

Therefore deterministic reproducibility holds.

## Replay Algorithm (practical pseudocode)

```text
function Replay(record R):
  s ← R.seed
  PRNG.init(s)
  state ← R.snapshot || canonical_initial_state
  for (entry in R.event_log):
    (t, input, binding, env) ← entry
    rnd ← PRNG.next()
    state ← ApplyBinding(binding, state, input, rnd, env)
    emit(state)        # for verification or debugging
  return state
```

`ApplyBinding` must be the same pure binding implementation used in production, with external non-deterministic ops stubbed to deterministic fakes (see caveats).

---

## Practical Caveats (so it doesn’t blow up in the wild)

You’ll only get reproducibility if you capture **all** sources of nondeterminism:

1. **External I/O / time** — if a transition depends on real-wall-clock or an external API, you must record the external response (or stub it deterministically in replay).
2. **Concurrency / races** — nondeterministic schedules require capturing the ordering (happens-before) or serializing events in (\mathcal{L}). Ideally record per-thread event sequence and synchronization events.
3. **Hardware-dependent randomness** — if the original used `/dev/urandom` unrelated to your seeded PRNG, you must record those outputs or derive them from the seed.
4. **Hidden state** — caches, file-system content, databases — either snapshot them or include version identifiers/timestamps and replay in a matched environment.
5. **Side-effects & idempotency** — ensure ApplyBinding in replay does not attempt to re-mutably call external services (it should be pure or use recorded responses).

If you can’t or won’t record those, you get partial reproducibility and angry engineers.

## On cryptography & seed choices (short, useful)

* Use a strong hash to derive seed: ( s = \mathrm{Trunc}\big(\mathrm{SHA256}(\text{GUID}|\text{time}|\text{nonce})\big) ).
* For security-sensitive replay, use a cryptographically secure PRNG (e.g., AES-CTR_DRBG or ChaCha20-DRBG), not simple LCG.
* Don’t use MD5. That was a rhetorical crime when computers were young and idealistic.

## Formal closure statement (one-liner)

The set of replayable executions is closed under composition: if traces (R_1) and (R_2) are individually reproducible and their concatenation records inter-trace orderings, then the concatenated trace (R_1\cdot R_2) is reproducible by replaying (R_1) then (R_2) (monoid closure + deterministic PRNG).
