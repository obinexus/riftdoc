# Memory Governance Test Procedure
## RIFT Pipeline QA Framework - Component Type: MEMORY_GOVERNANCE

### Integration Test Procedure (MANDATORY)

#### 1. Memory Token Validation
- **Objective**: Verify memory token creation, validation, and lifecycle management
- **AEGIS Compliance**: Validates data-oriented methodology in token management
- **Procedure**: 
  1. Create memory token with valid stage level
  2. Validate token ID uniqueness across governance engine
  3. Verify memory region allocation and entropy signature calculation
  4. Test context checksum generation using context-aware one-way function
  5. Validate token destruction and cleanup procedures
- **Expected Result**: All token operations complete with valid cryptographic signatures
- **Test File**: `test_memory_token_validation.c`
- **RIFT Stage Compliance**: Must pass for .rift.4 stage progression

#### 2. Governance Contract Compliance
- **Objective**: Ensure governance contract enforcement across stage transitions
- **Waterfall Phase**: Design validation through systematic contract testing
- **Procedure**:
  1. Load governance contract with stage-specific policies (.rift.0 → .rift.5)
  2. Test contract validation for each RIFT pipeline stage
  3. Verify policy enforcement mechanisms and violation detection
  4. Test anti-reversion protection and forward-only progression
- **Expected Result**: Contract violations properly detected and logged to telemetry
- **Test File**: `test_governance_contract_compliance.c`

#### 3. Anti-Reversion Protection Validation
- **Objective**: Verify forward-only stage progression enforcement
- **Security Model**: Tests transversal stage mapping protection
- **Procedure**:
  1. Attempt backward stage transitions (5→4, 4→3, etc.)
  2. Verify governance override mechanisms function correctly
  3. Test anti-reversion lock functionality at .rift.5 stage
  4. Validate telemetry logging of all reversion attempts
- **Expected Result**: Backward transitions blocked unless governance override applied
- **Test File**: `test_anti_reversion_protection.c`

#### 4. Context-Aware Validation Integration
- **Objective**: Ensure memory governance integrates with Hidden Cipher validation
- **Technical Foundation**: Based on Nnamdi Okpala's perfect number research
- **Procedure**:
  1. Calculate Shannon entropy for memory regions with configurable tolerance
  2. Verify divisor echo alignment for stage compliance (85%+ threshold)
  3. Test context checksum validation using 256-bit segmented signatures
  4. Validate entropy distribution analysis for high-entropy zones
- **Expected Result**: Context validation passes for structurally compliant memory
- **Test File**: `test_context_aware_validation.c`

### Manual Test Procedure (OPTIONAL)

#### 1. Governance Policy Review
- **Objective**: Manual verification of governance policy definitions
- **Methodology**: Systematic review following AEGIS waterfall documentation standards
- **Procedure**: Review governance contract definitions for completeness and accuracy
- **Reviewer**: QA Lead or Technical Architect
- **Documentation**: Policy review must be documented in QA artifact block

#### 2. Telemetry Output Verification
- **Objective**: Manual review of governance telemetry logging output
- **Procedure**: Examine violation logs and validation outcome logs for consistency
- **Reviewer**: QA Engineer
- **Compliance**: Ensure telemetry integration follows OBINexus logging standards

### Unit Test Procedure (RECOMMENDED)

#### 1. Memory Token Function Testing
- **Objective**: Test individual memory token functions in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 85% minimum for .rift.4 compliance
- **Test Framework**: Custom unit testing framework with mock dependencies
- **Boundary Conditions**: Test edge cases and error handling

#### 2. Governance Contract Function Testing  
- **Objective**: Test governance contract validation functions
- **Coverage Target**: 90% minimum for production readiness
- **Focus Areas**: Invalid stage transitions, malformed contracts, overflow conditions
